Page 5,"Introduction I started my career chasing unicorns. I joined Pinterest as employee number two, but in 2011, I left before my stock vested to build my own billion-dollar company . I had spent a weekend building the prototype of Gumroad, a tool that helped creators sell their products online. No complicated setup. No elaborate storefront. Just a link for customers to pay , and you’re in business. More than 50,000 people visited the site on the first day , and I was sure I was on the cusp of something big. The first step: raising money from VCs. As a 19-year-old solo founder , I found myself walking up and down the mythological Sand Hill Road, sweating through my jeans, having meetings in the same rooms where the decisions to fund companies like Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google had happened. I ended up raising more than $8 million in venture capital from renowned Silicon V alley investors including Accel Partners (early investor in Facebook), Kleiner Perkins (early investor in Google, Amazon, and Apple), Max Levchin (co-founder of PayPal), Naval Ravikant (co-founder of AngelList), and Chris Sacca (early investor in Twitter , Square, and Uber). They , too, thought they saw a unicorn galloping in the distance. The chase was on. In short order , I built a world-class team, recruiting talent out of companies like Stripe, Yelp, and Amazon. I was confident that I’d soon be strolling Allen & Company’ s annual Sun V alley conference, strategizing about the fight against malaria arm-in-arm with Bill Gates and W arren Buf fett. I was never in it for the money , I told myself. I wanted to make an impact, but quietly . When I became a tech titan, I was going to be the kind of titan magazine profiles called “down-to-earth.” I didn’t make it to Sun V alley that summer . Or the summer after that. The closest I ever got to Bill Gates was watching him speak at a Kleiner Perkins CEO summit. Gumroad’ s pitched flight into the stratosphere leveled of f after we burned through about $10 million in venture capital. After nine months of trying to raise more funding, we failed. In October 2015, I laid of f three-quarters of the staf f—including many good friends. Once the bleeding stopped, it was time to reassess. Gumroad was still operational, but I felt like a complete failure. With many in my circle still focused on raising money , hiring employees, and chasing their own billion-dollar companies—some successfully—I couldn’t bear to stick around Silicon V alley. For much of 2016, I kept my apartment in San Francisco but spent most of my time traveling and writing fiction, convinced that even if I couldn’t hack it in Startupland, I could still build a life for myself as a digital nomad. Like many , I was inspired by Tim Ferriss’ The Four Hour Workweek , but it didn’t take long to realize that operating Gumroad as a lifestyle business wasn’t for me. I was still trying to figure out what came next when I saw a tweet from one of my favorite authors about Brandon Sanderson’ s science fiction and fantasy workshop in Provo. In January 2017, I jumped on the opportunity to save rent and to save face by moving to 5",724
Page 6,"Utah where no one knew me and I could figure out how to regroup even as I kept Gumroad afloat as a one man show . I knew things would be very dif ferent in Provo, but the contrast still surprised me. In San Francisco, being successful means you’ve made a lot of money (which, in San Francisco, is a LOT of money). In Utah, it means you’re married and active in the church. My new Provo friends told me that I’d been crazy trying to build a billion-dollar company in the first place. Why wasn’t Gumroad good enough as it was? After all, I had a sustainable business serving a group of customers I loved. What more could I want? At first, I couldn’t quite grasp what they were talking about, but after living in Provo for a couple of years away from the white-hot epicenter of venture capital, I came to agree. While the unicorn I was chasing turned out to be more of a Shetland pony , my original vision was being realized. Thousands of creators were using Gumroad to build their own creative businesses. Real people in the real world were paying their mortgages or topping of f their kids’ college funds or simply paying for a few extra lattes by selling courses, e-books, and software online. This was exactly what I’d made Gumroad for , wasn’t it? Over time, I realized that the problem wasn’t Gumroad, the problem was me. I was still so focused on that elusive unicorn, I couldn’t see the thriving business humming along right in front of me. Gumroad was profitable, the right size for its market, and enabling more and more writers, coders, crafters, and other makers achieve their dreams with each passing day . Gumroad may have been a crappy investment for a few venture capitalists, but it was still a great company for its customers. In the year after the layof fs, when I worked by myself, Gumroad still sent approximately $40M to our creators, many of whom depended on us for their livelihoods. And this without any content marketing, paid advertising, or anything else. Just creators telling other creators. So when I recommitted to growing the company again in 2019, I was able to say “no” to most things I had said “yes” to previously , and to focus solely on what would create more value for our creators. It worked: in 2020 Gumroad sent over $140M to our creators, up 87% over the year before, while remaining profitable. Companies like mine may not grace the covers of glossy magazines or inspire Hollywood biopics, but they drive real, positive change and empower their founders, customers, and employees alike. I know that now , but it took me years to decouple my self-worth from my net worth and to realize that I hadn’t failed. I had succeeded. In February 2019, I wrote about my experience in a Medium essay , “Reflecting on My Failure to Build a Billion Dollar Company ,” that struck a chord with millions. Since then, I’ve had the chance to connect with entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs who, deep down, would much rather build a sustainable business like Gumroad than chase a unicorn. They just think it’ s weird and uncool to express that desire when the media and 6",715
Page 7,"our bigger-is-better culture keeps telling them that a unicorn is the only kind of business worth building. I know how they feel. When I started Gumroad, it never occurred to me to build a business without venture capital because that was the way everyone else seemed to be doing it. Most founders will say that the bigger the company , the bigger the impact they can make on the world. If they’re being candid, they’ll mention the secrets, networks, connections, mentors, and advice that magically come along with raising millions of dollars this way . I wanted all of it: impact, access, and the prospect of making a lot of money . But I was naive. Looking back, I didn’t fully understand what I was signing up for, and once I was in, I couldn’t leave. I’d sold a chunk of my company to investors who were going to be on Gumroad’ s capitalization table--list of owners--until death do us part. While that may be the right path for some startups, it’s not the right path for many more. Yet, plenty of early stage startups still end up raising venture capital because they can’t fund their businesses in a sustainable way through profits. As a result, they’re locked into the pursuit of huge, winner-take-all markets where growth is the most important asset of their business, not revenues, profits, or sustainability . To help me reconcile those dif ferences, I had to come up with my own framework for how to start and to scale my business. The questions I had to ask myself over and over again are: What do I actually care to change? If I could fix one thing about my corner of the world, what would that be? What kind of business do I really want to build? And most importantly , what kind of impact do I really want to make? I’m not the only one. Many others have had similar realizations, including many whose stories I’ve included in this book. I call these people “minimalist entrepreneurs,” and they run what I call “minimalist businesses.” Building a minimalist business doesn’t mean settling for second best. Instead, it's about creating sustainable companies that have the flexibility to take risks to serve the greater good, all while empowering others to do the same. Being profitable, hopefully from the very beginning, means being able to focus and to stay focused on the reasons you started a business in the first place: to help others. Historically , entrepreneurs have played a crucial role in driving technological and social progress. This is even more necessary today , when big corporations are required by law to prioritize shareholder value over , among other things, actual value. In researching this book, I’ve found countless examples of businesses such as Basecamp, Wistia, Missouri Star Quilt Company , and many other honest-to-goodness, highly scalable companies incredibly focused on solving meaningful problems with beautiful products, services, and software that people love – and making a profit doing it. Each company goes about things their own way depending on the community they’re building for . Some are incorporated as Certified B Corporations and have charters to direct their work and keep themselves accountable. Others strongly advocate for conscious capitalism, 7",691
Page 8,"self-organizing principles, and worker ownership. But they all focus on problem-solving for a specific community and not taking themselves so seriously . No matter their differences, we can learn from them all. Unfortunately , the word “entrepreneur” has a weird taint to it. I remember going to “Career Day” at school, and not identifying with the “entrepreneurs” at all. They seemed like businessmen (they were always men), and I didn’t like business. I liked making things! But eventually I realized that a business is not an end in and of itself. A business is a tool to make or do stuf f. It’s a legal structure; that’s it. At first I didn’t need a company , but eventually my creations required a legal structure, a team, and an operation to make the stuf f I wanted to make. I saw that the best way to solve the problem I wanted to solve was to start a business around it. That’ s how I became a founder . When I made my transition from unicorn chaser to minimalist entrepreneur , I had to wrap my head around another new normal. This book is about exploding the myths we tell ourselves about the best way to build impactful businesses for the abstract, singular “world,” and about seeking the truth about how to build the businesses that will make us and our communities wealthier , healthier , and happier . In the end, my failure to launch Gumroad into the stratosphere was the best thing that ever happened to me because it taught me the very real consequences behind a “growth at all costs” mindset. Unfortunately , it took me eight years to realize this, and a lot of suf fering. I hope this book will help other aspiring entrepreneurs learn the lessons I learned without the painful layof fs and years of soul-searching. The overwhelming response to the viral essay I wrote about my experience is more proof that this promise resonates with many . This book, part manifesto, part manual, will explain the core principles of these new , right-sized businesses and help you design, build, and successfully grow your own. Now, let’s get into it! 8",469
Page 9,"Chapter 1. The minimalist entrepreneur [epi] The beginnings of all things are small. 1 - Cicero ______________________________________________________________________ One of Atlanta-based web developer Peter Askew’ s favorite things in the world is to get things of f the top shelf at the supermarket for people who can’t reach the same heights that he can as a 6’8” former high school basketball star. Now Askew sees being helpful as the pillar of his business strategy , but it wasn’t always that way . When the dot com bubble burst in 2001 and he was laid of f from Etour , a websurfing guide he helped build and grow , he had to ask himself, “Is this how I want to live? Is this how I can be of service to the world?” He knew he could get another job thanks to his background in marketing analytics, but he was also disillusioned. Money and prestige were not nearly as important to him as independence and freedom. Eventually he wound up with another role in advertising where he was exposed to a wide range of business models as thousands of new web businesses came online, but in the evening and on weekends, he threw himself into his side projects, learning about web development, domain names, and how to monetize web traf fic. That’ s how he stumbled on an idea that would change his life. What if instead of buying new domain names, which often took months to rank highly in search engine results, he bought expired domain names, which already had some degree of visibility? Other people were parking ads on expired domains or flipping them, but Askew had something else in mind, the seed of an idea that was driven by the questions he had started to ask himself about his work. Rather than trying to make a quick buck, he would build real businesses around domain names, asking himself with each one, “Do I feel inspired? Is there a real business here?” and, most of all, “Can I be helpful?” He experimented with random created names and ventures that didn’t quite work before he realized that “ the domain name always comes first, the business idea comes second.” In 2009, that domain name was duderanch.com. Askew bought it and 2 launched a directory , traveling to more than 50 dude ranches to meet the owners of the destinations he featured on his site. Eventually , he partnered with the owner of guestranches.com, and the two built a curated list of destination ranches around the country . The success of that venture, which he worked on for ten years and sold in 2 000 the business idea comes second: Peter Askew, “I sell onions on the Internet,” Deep South Ventures, April 2019, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/. 1 000 all things are small: Cicero, De finibus bonorum et malorum , Book V, Chapter 58. 9",628
Page 10,"2019, gave him the time and financial freedom to buy more domain names and to develop other niche businesses. Some succeeded, others didn’t. 3 In 2014, Askew saw that V idaliaOnions.com was up for auction. Up until then, he had focused on information-based businesses, but something about the domain name appealed to him. So did the onions, frankly . As a Georgia native, he knew of V idalias—a sweet, mild variety of onion that some fans eat raw like an apple. The only trouble was that he didn’t know anything about the onion business. Or farming in general, for that matter . 4 Regardless, he put down a $2,200 bid, confident that someone in the business would come in higher . (If bidding on interesting domain names like this sounds like a neat hobby , you may be a minimalist entrepreneur .) When he won the auction five minutes later, he was pleasantly surprised, but he filed it away for later and went back to work on other projects. As the days went by though, he couldn’t stop thinking about V idalias. “[The domain] kept nudging me,” he writes in his essay , “I sell onions on the Internet,” and “after a month, I began to understand what it was telling me. That I buy pears from Harry & David every year , and I should mimic that same service for V idalia Onions. Instead of farm-to-door pears, farm-to-door V idalia Onions.” He saw a way he could be helpful to 5 others, and a new minimalist business was born. Askew didn’t eat V idalias himself, but he knew that many people did, both from his own experience and from strong search volume for the phrase on Google Trends. Even though he believed he was on to something, he still had his doubts. “I’m not a farmer ,” he worried. “I have no logistics or distribution system setup.” 6 He got started anyway . His first step was to reach out to a trade group that put him in touch with Aries Haygood, the owner of an award-winning Vidalia farm in operation for over two decades that had, crucially , a packing shed. He used his own money to put up a new site on V idaliaOnions.com, and then “[while] the farm concentrated on the V idalia, I concentrated on customer service, marketing, branding, web development, & logistics,” he recalled. “I didn’t have other projects that were this front-facing, customer wise. And I discovered I immensely enjoyed it.” Askew and Haygood estimated fifty orders for their first season. They received more than six hundred. 7 7 000 more than six hundred : Ibid. 6 000 no logistics or distribution system setup : Ibid. 5 000 farm-to-door Vidalia Onions: Ibid. 4 000 for that matter : Askew, “I sell onions on the Internet.” 3 000 Some succeeded, others didn’t : Peter Askew, “The dude That built DudeRanch.com,” Deep South Ventures, September 2019, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/dude-that-built-duderanch-com/. 10",711
Page 11,"It would be at this point in the lifecycle of a VC-funded business that the investors would start getting frisky . “Six hundred orders when we expected fifty?” they’d exclaim. “Time to quintuple your hiring rate and open a few offices around the country . Come to think of it, what does the international market for Vidalia onions look like? A few million in ad spending, a viral video, and we’ll have V idalias trending worldwide. W e’ll probably need people on the ground in London, Tokyo, and Sydney . Time to raise another round.” And on it goes. Picture a little kid blowing a balloon up for the first time, until... Askew himself couldn’t help but consider trying to accelerate the company’ s growth, but he stuck to what he had learned over the years and focused instead on profitability . He knew that the previous owners of V idaliaOnions.com had gone belly up trying to sell salad dressings and relishes in addition to the onions themselves. So instead, he slowly built the business in front of him, figuring out how to sell V idalia onions to the market of potential customers within the range of timely and affordable shipping from that one packing shed. He made mistakes, of course. At one point, he lost thousands of dollars on faulty shipping boxes, an error that nearly shuttered the operation. But he also made small process improvements year-by-year like implementing an automated shipping system rather than manually entering customer orders and printing UPS labels. A few years in, the business was profitable, growing organically at its own pace, and he was having fun. 8 Six years in, Askew’ s pet project has become a full-fledged business, which makes his many customers happy and makes a positive impact in the local community . He no longer sees it as just another experiment along with all of his other cast-of f domain names. V idaliaOnions.com is becoming his mission: Honestly , my customers would be quite upset if we disappeared. Last season, while I called a gentleman back regarding a phone order , his wife answered. While I introduced myself, she interrupted me mid-sentence and hollered in exaltation to her husband: “THE VIDALIA MAN! THE VIDALIA MAN! PICK UP THE PHONE!” At that moment, I realized we were doing something right. Something helpful. Something that was making a positive impact...It’ s immensely gratifying. I feel so fortunate to be associated with this industry . 9 Maybe it’ s the onions, but Askew’ s story brings a tear to my eye. There is something profoundly beautiful in a value-oriented mission and a genuine purpose driven by your own lived experience. This is what being a minimalist entrepreneur is all about: Making a difference while making a living. [head A] 9 000 associated with the industry : Ibid. 8 000 he was having fun : Ibid. 11",628
Page 12,"The minimalist entrepreneur Before I started to write this book, I wouldn’t have described myself as a minimalist entrepreneur , mostly because I had never heard of such a thing. If you had asked me, I would have said I was a founder committed to a new kind of startup, one that prioritized profitability over growth and positive impact over moving fast and breaking things. Mostly , I was determined to create value for our customers and our team. But in the years since I changed course with Gumroad, I noticed that more and more friends, colleagues, and acquaintances were taking the same approach to building their own companies. People that you’ll meet in this book like Peter Askew or Laura Roeder of MeetEdgar and Paperbell. W e exchanged ideas on Twitter or at conferences, and the more people I talked to, the more I felt we should label this new pathway to success, one that isn’t dependent on flashy growth or unsustainable metrics. One that uses the advent of software to democratize business creation for everyone. Updating the status quo has always been the true function of entrepreneurship. That’ s been my goal since the beginning even if achieving that goal has taken shape in a way I could never have imagined. But now I see that if everyone knew that being a minimalist entrepreneur was an option, I suspect a whole lot more of us would have pursued this path from the start. Minimalist entrepreneurs are all unique, but we all build businesses according to these eight principles: [INSER T ART1] 12",317
Page 13,"● PROFIT ABILITY - Minimalist entrepreneurs create businesses that are profitable at all costs. Many businesses never intend to stick around long enough to be profitable. Instead, the plan is to sell the business before profits become necessary , raising money from investors along the way . Minimalist entrepreneurs aim to be profitable from day one or soon after because profit is oxygen. And you do that by selling a product, not by collecting and selling user data. From the start, you should be selling to your users, not selling your users. ● COMMUNITY - Minimalist entrepreneurs put community first. Be observant and cultivate authentic relationships. Eventually you’ll notice one of your communities stubbing its toe on a problem it just can’t solve. That’ s your business idea. Or you can solve your own problem and offer the solution to real people in the real communities you belong to. Since you’ve taken time and ef fort to build trust at the outset, you’ll have a much easier time selling to your first customers once you reach product-market fit. It’ s much cheaper , too. ● PROCESS - Minimalist entrepreneurs build only what they need to, automating or outsourcing the rest. Minimalist businesses do one thing and do it well. You assume your customers are competent and able to articulate their own problems. Then, you work with them to come up with the best possible solution, and make sure it’ s worth paying for , before you take it to customers outside your initial communities. Most importantly , never over-build. 13",330
Page 14,"● DISCOVER Y - Minimalist entrepreneurs don’t sell - they educate. Selling is a discovery process that gets you to product-market fit, so minimalist entrepreneurs use sales as an opportunity to talk to potential customers one-by-one about their product while simultaneously educating themselves about their customers. It’ s a long game built on relationships, not a one-day , grand opening extravaganza followed by selling to strangers. ● TRANSP ARENCY - Minimalist entrepreneurs tell the truth. The best marketing shows the world who you and your company really are, so share your stories, from struggle to success. If you understand that people care about other people, you can use marketing to educate, inspire, and entertain, which leads to empathy , which leads to community , which leads to sales, which leads to audience, which leads to growth. Plus, this kind of marketing is free. ● GROWTH - Minimalist entrepreneurs own their businesses, they don’t let their businesses own them. To grow , you have to scale your company , but you don’t spend money you don’t have or sacrifice profitability to get there. Try not to make company killing mistakes, but don’t let fear hold you back. You grow by doing things you’re unqualified to do, but you’re also careful not to lose sight of the bottom line (or your own needs) in the process. Most of all, keep the focus on your customers. ● CULTURE - Minimalist entrepreneurs hire other minimalist entrepreneurs. The way you do things may not be for everyone. That’ s okay. Build the kind of company you want to work for , define your values early and often, and tell the world who you are. Like-minded folks will find you. Conventional wisdom about how we work, when we work, and who we work with is changing fast, which means you can make new rules that help you and the people around you be as effective, and as happy , as possible. ● PURPOSE - Minimalist entrepreneurs know that life is about more than just your company . Being a minimalist entrepreneur is about making a dif ference while making a living. Impact isn’t just exchanging code for dollars, though there’ s nothing wrong with making money . The true magic of entrepreneurship is that you and your business can improve the quality of life of many people. And it doesn’t have to be millions; “enough” is what you decide, not a universal benchmark. The eight principles of being a minimalist entrepreneur each map to a function of the minimalist business–and not coincidentally , to the chapters in this book. Each chapter builds on the previous one – just as addition leads to multiplication leads to algebra leads to calculus – until finally , at the end of the book, you’ll be fully equipped to become a minimalist entrepreneur yourself. If this makes perfect sense to you, great. The ideas here will inspire you to make the 14",625

If you’re still skeptical, well, you’ve probably been reading the same kinds of headlines and cover stories I was reading in 201 1. Back then, I saw the world in black-and-white: I could chase unicorns or I could retire on a beach. I had no idea that what would make me and many others truly happy was the middle path. It may take a little more time to let go of all that venture capital programming and to create and then realize the same kind of vision for yourself and for your business. Just keep reading! [head A] Chase profitability , not unicorns One of the keys to understanding the minimalist entrepreneur mindset is embracing profitability , not growth, as the key indicator of your company’ s success. Building a minimalist business may not be a get rich quick proposition, but it is a get rich slowly one if you use this one principle as a north star for your decision making. Profitability means sustainability . It doesn’t mean treading water until a lifeboat comes along to save you, which is how many founders I know think about raising their next round of VC funding. It means building your own boat. And while I do think the minimalist entrepreneur mindset leads to a near-100% success rate, I’m willing to concede that it may only happen over the course of many experiments. That’ s why profitability is really the only metric that matters. If you’re profitable, you can take many shots on goal and maximize your chance of getting to a place where you can take unlimited shots on goal, virtually guaranteeing your success as long as you keep learning from and building for your customers. I’m optimistic that we’re moving past an era of gatekeeping, where bosses and universities and venture capitalists decide who gets to try and who doesn’t. Information about how to start and scale companies is now available to founders around the world, and there are fewer and fewer reasons to raise venture capital. That’ s a great thing! Every time founders go that route, raise money , and trade away partial ownership of their companies, they take a big step away from building true success in the form of sustainable, profitable businesses based on deep customer knowledge and solid financials. Some eventually make their way back, years later, but many never do. Instead, the companies die and the customers are left abandoned. Why does this happen? The venture capital business is a high-risk, high-return investment strategy in which venture funds swap capital for early-stage startup equity , essentially buying a piece of the future value of the companies in which they invest. For the model to work, the rare winners like Uber , Airbnb, and Stripe need to pay for all the losers. Aileen Lee of Cowboy V entures coined the term “unicorn” to refer to privately 15",619
Page 16,"held startups valued at more than $1 billion, which are the lifeblood of venture funds. 10 In fairy tales, people can’t help chasing unicorns—they are nearly irresistible—but they’re also rare, elusive, and nearly impossible to catch. Her mythological metaphor couldn’t have been more apt. Almost everyone fails to build billion-dollar businesses, even the founders who raise gobs of venture capital. In 2019, 142 unicorns, 78 of them in the United States, were born, representing just 1% of the 11 companies that raised seed funding from venture capitalists. 12 So what happens to the other 99%? It’ s actually a matter of debate, and the answer depends on what you consider failure. According to Matt Murphy , Managing Director and Partner of Menlo V entures, approximately 70% of startups fail, which can mean anything from full liquidation to becoming cash flow positive, which despite being good 13 for the company is still bad for the VC. Of the 30% still standing, he says, some return 14 three to five times the initial investment, which constitutes only modest success in this setting. The whole system is riding on at least five percent of VC-backed companies delivering 10 to 100x returns to balance out losses and make it all worth it. Without 15 them, the precarious VC model simply doesn’t work. That’ s because the outsized success of the rare billion-dollar startup compensates for all the money thrown against the wall like so much spaghetti on thousands of other ventures. There’ s nothing inherently wrong with raising money , and not all unicorns are evil. I raised money for Gumroad (and, as you’ll read later , will again, but in a very dif ferent way), and there are companies like Pinterest, L yft, Slack, and others that raised venture capital, grew quickly , yet stayed focused on their customers. But much of the venture capital model depends on creating unsustainable growth and on spending money that the business wouldn’t have without having raised money . That’ s not what minimalist entrepreneurs do.

Page 17,"[head A] Don’t call it a comeback Many truly great businesses have been built by passionate individuals around the world who have founded mission-driven, value-focused profit generators that never set out to crack a billion dollars in the first place. They’ve just always tended to fly under the radar . For up and coming minimalist entrepreneurs, that history can serve as an example even as new online tools make the process of building, marketing, and selling almost frictionless, even for solopreneurs and independent creators. This is truly the dawn of a whole new class of business run by entrepreneurs who aren’t willing to sacrifice their autonomy and spirit in pursuit of a big win. Take a good, hard look at the people, places, and communities you care about. Where are the pain points? What isn’t working, but might—with a little elbow grease? These are all opportunities to make things better through minimalist entrepreneurship. It’ s ironic to me how often people go around hoping to find a startup idea while simultaneously complaining about all the everyday stuff around them that just doesn’t work properly . “Sure, I could solve that for people with a little ef fort, but the potential market just isn’t big enough to really scale.” That’ s the kind of thinking that this book seeks to address. It’s time to stop chasing unicorns through a forest of opportunities. No matter where you work, how you work, or who you work for right now , you can use the principles in this book to rethink the beliefs and practices that may be holding you back. That’ s because I believe that starting a business should be for everyone no matter your background. You may already be on your business-building journey , but if you’re just getting started, some business models lend themselves more easily to the pathway of minimalist entrepreneurship. These include almost any kind of business-to-consumer or business-to-business enterprise that has fast customer feedback loops and ample opportunities for iteration like software as a service (SaaS), digital and physical products and services, or connecting people for a fee. W e’ll talk about all of these business models later in the book. There are also businesses that aren’t necessarily suited for this framework because of the slow pace of customer feedback. For example, any business that requires a heavy investment in research and development or that relies on sales to large, bureaucratized corporations or institutions like Fortune 100 companies, academia, or hospitals might not match up as well with the processes and systems I recommend. The good news is that what constitutes a “business” is changing faster than ever before and opening up possibilities to a wider range of innovators. Though this shift was in motion before 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated it and drove increased interest in entrepreneurship from people of all backgrounds. Now more than ever before, we don’t need to move to a place called Silicon Valley, go to a school called Harvard or Stanford, and raise money from the venture capitalists. The internet lets you 17",641
Page 18,"learn from anywhere, network with anyone, and raise money directly from customers. Our collective prosperity now depends on widespread entrepreneurship, and the paths to doing so are more varied and well-oiled than ever before. The world desperately needs the solutions that only entrepreneurs can provide. Everyday problems are all around us, and the vast majority are hidden from the view of the Silicon V alley software engineers and Ivy League over-achievers who have been anointed as our entrepreneurial class. W e need to empower and encourage entrepreneurs from every corner of the planet and every stratum of society . It’s down to individual creators and entrepreneurs like us to set better goals for ourselves and our businesses. After all, problems don’t solve themselves. People do. [head A] Creator first On paper , it seems simple enough: 1. Narrow down who your ideal customer is. Narrow until you can narrow no more. 2. Define exactly what pain point you are solving for them, and how much they will pay you to solve it. 3. Set a hard deadline and focus fully on building a solution, then charge for it. 4. Repeat the process until you’ve found a product that works, then scale a business around it. In practice, it’ s not so simple. There are many complications that pop up, and most people don’t even know where to start. A “business” of any kind is too scary , too amorphous, or too unattainable. Luckily , there’ s another way to get started today . Before you become an entrepreneur , become a Creator . That could mean being an artist, but it doesn’t have to. Creators make things, charge their audiences for those things, and then use that money to make more things. They use the first dollars they earn as tools to fuel their own creative drive, not the other way around. With time and experience, Creators show others how to turn their own creativity into businesses, and the cycle continues. In the end, there isn’t much dif ference between a business like Gumroad and a Creator . It’s just semantics. One or more people using the tool of a business to make something new. Painters need brushes. Writers need pencils. Creators need businesses. It’ s key for people to understand that, because it lowers the cognitive barrier to starting a business, and starting is really important. My best friend in middle school, obsessed with the computer game World of W arcraft , started designing fantasy creatures in Photoshop. I was impressed, but I also remember thinking, I could do that . So I went through some Photoshop tutorials and got to work. When I started to get the hang of the software, I began submitting logos to online 18",577
Page 19,"competitions. I didn’t win any , but the process of creating a lot of stuf f and putting it out there made me a pretty decent designer , and then led to freelance web design work. Once you’re working on other people’ s projects, you can’t help but get ideas of your own, so I began building simple web applications, hiring developers to help with the coding. For example, before Twitter natively supported threads, I created an app called Tweader to see the conversations that happened between people on Twitter . Another app, Ping Me When It’ s Up, would text me when a website that had gone down was back up again. (It should be clear by now that I’ve never been very good at naming things.) When the iPhone App Store opened, I learned to code for it by taking a free course on iOS development from Stanford through iT unes University , called CS193P (I still recommend it!). The App Store handled all the financial aspects of selling what I made to customers around the world, which meant I could focus on creating apps. Perfect. The first app I built was called Taxi Lah! and it let users call a cab from their phones--before Uber . I put it on the App Store for fellow Singaporeans and made a few thousand dollars. Then I made an app called Color Stream that let designers create and modify color palettes on their phones. I made about ten thousand dollars from that. Each time, I was trying to solve a problem I had. I wanted to design and build a little bit of software to make my life–and others’–a little bit better . This experience – shipping real products to real customers – led to my first job at Pinterest, where I designed and built the Pinterest iPhone app. While I was there, I built Gumroad in my spare time to help me sell an icon I designed in Photoshop. When I found a solution that worked, I sold it to other creators who sold their products to their own community of creators, many of whom eventually became Gumroad customers themselves. Now I’m an honest-to-goodness entrepreneur without ever having really given it much conscious thought along the way . The App Store made it possible for me to fully embrace my creative side, clearing the marketing and financial obstacles out of my way , so I could become a Creator . That transition led to me becoming a founder . It’s an upward, virtuous cycle. Creation begets more creation. Today , Gumroad does the exact same thing for other would-be Creators. It’s basically a glorified Sahil-cloning factory . Isn’t that beautiful? (My mom thinks it is.) Max Ulichney is an art director and illustrator based in Los Angeles. He’d always imagined he’d spend his days working at a large company to pay the bills in return for a few hours in the evening to do his own work. He spent fifteen years as an art director at the same creative agency , eventually using an iPad app called Procreate to draw and paint in between meetings. One day , a couple of years ago, Max decided to sell some of the digital “brushes” he’d designed for his own use to other Procreate users. A few hundred dollars later , he decided it was worth the effort to continue selling the digital tools as a business. The other day , Max and I had dinner to celebrate his quitting the job 19",723
Page 20,"at the agency to work on Maxpacks full time. Afterwards, he paid for the meal and drove off in his brand-new Tesla. There are thousands of Gumroad creator stories like Max’ s. Unfortunately , most of them don’t involve free food. Adam W athan and Steve Schoger teach people how to build and design web applications. They believe, as I do, that nearly anyone can become a competent front-end engineer and designer with a little help. In December 2018, they released Refactoring UI, an online course, earning over $800,000 in a single month. Now they get to spend their time doing what they really love: building Tailwind, a free and open-source framework for the rapid creation of custom web designs. Kristina Garner , mother of two boys, teaches families how to run secular , nature-based homeschooling programs for their kids. What started as a blog about her personal passion has become Blossom and Root, a business that employs dozens and helps thousands of families every month. These are just a few of the 28,207 creators who sold something on Gumroad last month. Many of our sellers earned enough for their month’ s rent, many more enough for a few cups of cof fee. Now I focus on “helping creators earn a living doing what they love,” but I started somewhere smaller and less lofty . That’ s where creation always begins: at the number next to zero. Creatio ex nihilo . Where there was nothing, now there’ s something: digital brushes, online courses, V idalia Onions on your doorstep. In the next chapter , I’ll show you how to get started.

Page 22,"Chapter 2. Community first It takes a village to raise a child. - African proverb In 2009, Sol Orwell was overweight and unhappy , so he decided to join the “/r/Fitness” subreddit, one of the thousands of smaller online communities within Reddit, to find information and support. At the same time, he started reading about fitness and nutrition, taking notes on what he was learning in books like Tim Ferriss’ s The 4-Hour Body and posting summaries on the fitness subreddit for other members of the community . Reddit was a natural place for Orwell to seek connection. He was already participating in the NBA subreddit and the Toronto subreddit among others, so he knew and understood Reddit’ s rules and norms about only posting authentic, useful content. The more he learned about fitness and nutrition, the more he shared. In addition to his reading notes, he answered questions and documented his personal journey of losing 60 pounds in order to inspire others. He credits his physical transformation to the relationships he formed with other “redditors” including Kurtis Frank, one of the moderators of r/Fitness. Eventually , Sol and Kurtis ended up moderating the subreddit together , and as time went by , they noticed two persistent problems. First, there was little reliable information available about nutritional supplements, either from other redditors or from the companies that made these products; second, almost every day , new members asked the same questions over and over again, many times about supplements. Sol was frustrated by both situations, but eventually he realized that maybe the resources people needed just weren’t out there. Sol and Kurtis saw a job to be done for a community that they cared about and had 16 nurtured from 5,000 to about 50,000 during the two years they had been moderating. In 2011, they launched Examine.com, a website where people could find unbiased, up-to-date research and information on nutrition and supplements. 17 He and Kurtis focused on building their research database and on of fering free, unbiased, science-based information that they themselves had been looking for . They told people about their project, but they didn’t sell anything, and they only occasionally dropped links in the fitness subreddit when they were answering questions. Instead, other members of the community did it for them. After all, they had been part of Reddit 17 000 nutrition and supplements : Benji Hyam, “How Examine.com Founder Sol Orwell Built A 7-Figure Business Off Of Reddit,” Grow and Convert , April 13, 2018, https://growandconvert.com/marketing/examine-sol-orwell-reddit/. 16 000 a job to be done : Sol Orwell, interview with Eric Siu, Leveling Up, podcast audio, June 9, 2019, https://www.levelingup.com/growth-everywhere-interview/sol-orwell-examine-com/. 22",610
Page 23,"at this point for about five years. Sol remembers they both had something like “100,000 plus karma,” a measure of how much a user has contributed to Reddit based on 18 upvotes and comments from other users - so people trusted them, and they were 19 solving a problem for the fitness subreddit without asking for anything in return. In 2013, two years after they started the site, they started to think about monetizing, so they surveyed the community about what problems they felt the information on Examine.com might be able to solve. “W e would ask people, ‘what’ s your problem? What do you wish you could do?’ Sol remembers. The most common thing was ‘we wish you just had a table of all of the information you have. So if I wanted to look at supplements that af fect blood pressure, I could look it up quickly .’” Because of those answers, they of fered their first product, The Research Digest, a comprehensive guide to supplements and nutrition. 20 Sol was well known in the health and nutrition space, and to promote The Research Digest, he leveraged his relationships with fitness professionals four years after initially joining the fitness subreddit. When he and Kurtis launched, 105 people in the fitness industry shared the link. The goal was 1000 sales, and by the end of the first day , they had already sold 600-800 copies. By the end of the launch, they sold 3000 copies, all based on reputation, trust, and word of mouth. 21 Fast forward to today , and Sol is happy , healthy , and teaching others about entrepreneurship. Examine.com continues to be an important resource for health and nutrition professionals; it has 70,000 visitors per day and does seven figures in annual revenue though Sol has stepped back from the day-to-day operations. The team has 22 expanded Examine’ s offerings to include additional guides and subscription services on how supplements not only factor into fitness but also into longevity , chronic disease, and psychological health. But they’ve never lost their focus on community and continue to depend on the trust and relationships that grew authentically over time. In this chapter , we’ll talk about how you can find your own communities (if you haven’t already) and how to uncover the kinds of problems that might be best suited for a minimalist business. I won’t lie. This process takes time, but done right, and most of all, done authentically , it will be the basis of how you move forward now and for years to 22 000 day-to-day operations : “About Sol Orwell,” SJO.com, August 9, 2018, https://www.sjo.com/about/. 21 000 word of mouth : Ibid. 20 000 guide to supplements and nutrition : Hyam, “How Examine Founder Sol Orwell Built A 7-Figure Business Off Of Reddit.” 19 000 comments from other users : “What Is Karma?” Reddit Help, Accessed March 1, 2021, https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204511829-What-is-karma-#:~:text=A%20user's%20karma% 20reflects%20how,that%20user%20gains%20some%20karma. 18 000 100,000 plus karma : Sol Orwell, Leveling Up. 23",721
Page 24,"come. Whether you’re just getting started or you’re already in the process of building a product, knowing and contributing to your community is key at every stage. Remember that, and you’ll find and nurture the right atmosphere for collaboration, growth, and eventually a sustainable business that matters. [head A] Community first Community is a fundamental societal unit. From Sol's r/Fitness subreddit to yoga classes to family to the group of friends we game with in the middle of the night, communities are a place where we can connect, learn, and have fun. For minimalist entrepreneurs, communities are the starting point of any successful enterprise. That doesn’t mean you should run out and find a community to join for the purpose of starting a business. It means that most businesses fail because they aren’t built with a particular group of people in mind. The ones that succeed do so because they’re focused on a community that a founder knows well. That process can’t be rushed because it comes from authentic relationships and a willingness to serve, both of which take time to uncover and develop. Communities used to be limited by geography , but it’ s never been easier to connect to people with whom you share something in common, whether it be an interest, a favorite artist, or a belief system. But a community isn’t a group of people who all think, act, look, or behave the same. That’ s a cult. A community is the opposite. That’ s what I discovered when I moved from San Francisco to Provo and got out of the Silicon V alley bubble. For one of the first times in my life, I saw that the best communities are made up of individuals who might be otherwise dissimilar but who have shared interests, values, and abilities. It’ s a group of people who would likely never hang out with each other in any other situational context, and it often encompasses virtually every identity including, yes, politics. A community can override people’ s dislike of one another . Every Sunday in the LDS church, I saw the progressive next to the conservative, the rich next to the poor , the young next to the old. I’m not sure what they thought of each other outside the church building, but for at least one day a week, they sat together for the sake of the community . But it wasn’t easy . It was real work to be an active participant in that church community , and for the first time in a long time, I was reminded of something important. You don’t have to bring your whole self to every community you join, but you do have to bring a slice of yourself, and that part needs to be authentic to its core. Being real and being vulnerable is what opens the door to relationships and to growth. [INSER T ART2] 24",595
Page 25,"Part of my own growth was realizing that as an outsider , I was in a particularly great position to see the community with fresh eyes and to contribute value in a new way . You may never move to a new city , but getting out of your bubble matters when it comes to community . And it’ s healthy and normal to leave certain communities as you explore new ones. For me, my move from Silicon V alley to the Silicon Slopes showed me that I didn't care too much about tech, at least not in the way that I thought I did. In Utah, I didn’t go to JavaScript meetups or attend design lectures or judge startup pitch competitions. Instead, I found myself at figure drawing classes. Or a few hundred feet away from a barn, learning how to plein air paint. Or at a cof fee shop on Thursday mornings, writing and reviewing science fiction stories with a few friends I met at a workshop. Finding these creative communities IRL reminded me of the spark that had inspired me in the early days. Rediscovering myself as a creator and spending time with other makers and creators reconnected me to why I had built Gumroad in the first place: I loved to create! I couldn’t believe I had forgotten that, for years. I was accidentally at the forefront of a movement that was taking shape, what Li Jin, former Partner at Andreessen Horowitz and founder of Atelier V entures, calls the Passion Economy , “a world in which people are able to do what they love for a living 23 and to have a more fulfilling and purposeful life.” At the time I created Gumroad, online 24 24 000 a more fulfilling and purposeful life : Atelier Ventures, Accessed January 25, 2021, https://www.atelierventures.co/. 23 000 the Passion Economy : Li Jin, “The Passion Economy and the Future of Work,” Andreessen Horowitz, April 25, 2020, https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/. 25",429
Page 26,"creator platforms were still new , but the rise of no-code solutions has made building and charging for podcasts, video and audio content, online courses, virtual teaching, and virtual coaching almost seamless so that starting a business around something you love has never been more attainable. You probably have something you enjoy , something that on its face has nothing to do with your “real” job. Maybe it’ s marathon running or ceramics or electronic music or another passion that you pursue in your free time. Whatever it is, building a minimalist business around the people you love to spend time with and the ways you love to spend your time depends on being part of an authentic community . You may already be thinking about how to solve the problems of a current community you participate in or you may simply be planning to join a community based on something you love. Either way, finding your people is really important at the beginning. Not just for the sake of your business but also for the sake of your own well-being. Taking writing and painting classes in Provo reminded me that my community wasn’t just the people in front of me, it was also a wider group who wanted, like me, to “turn their passions into livelihoods.” The real communities I was a part of didn’t care about 25 growth at all costs; that kind of accelerated expansion would have cracked them into a million little pieces. Instead, their priority , like mine, was connecting to each other in ways that allowed for the space, time, and freedom to explore their interests and to eventually transform their passions into businesses in meaningful ways.

Page 27,"Many people struggle to consciously place themselves within communities, even though everyone is already a part of several. If you’re reading this and wondering which communities you’re already a part of, ask yourself this question: “Where do I spend my time when I’m not working or with my family?” Remember , you are already in several communities, though you may not realize which ones yet. One way to list out every community you are in is by asking: If I talk, who listens? Where and with whom do I already spend my time, online and offline? In what situations am I most authentically myself? Who do I hang out with, even though I don’t really like them, but it’ s worth it since we share something more important in common? Spend an hour , at least. Let yourself think you’ve run out of ideas at least a few times. In the list you end up creating, you’ll find the people you are meant to serve. You may be tempted to skip this exercise if you’ve already started a business, but I believe that 27",237
Page 28,"doing this regularly is a good opportunity to remind yourself why you’re doing what you’re doing and most importantly who you’re doing it for. From here, you can turn your list of communities into a list of locations–geographic and online–in which to spend even more time learning and contributing: ● For every group with a shared interest, there’ s a Facebook group, a Reddit community , a Twitter or Instagram hashtag, or some other form of gathering and sharing ideas on the web. There are often multiple. Join them all. ● There are communities run by the businesses that service that community; forums, groups, and more. Join them too. ● There are also notable teachers, with online classes that also function as communities. They may be worth joining–though be mindful of the cost. ● Of course, there are the in-person communities! There are meetups, workshops, classes, speaker series, networking events, and more. It’s important to note that your goal here is to join communities , not networks. [INSER T ART4] 28",229
Page 29,"In a network, such as Facebook, Twitter , or Instagram, newcomers start at zero. No one says “hi” when they walk in the door , and if they have something to say , there’ s no guarantee that anyone will hear or help. I learned that the hard way when I was living and working in San Francisco. I thought I was part of a community while I lived there, but eventually I realized that it was neither a group of people who shared something in common nor one that cared deeply for each other . Instead, it was a network of transactional relationships, with every node trying to get ahead. Networks, in person or online, aren’t bad. Sometimes they can lead to genuine and meaningful connection, especially over time, as you gain friends and followers and the algorithms start to recommend your work and your content to people who don’t already know you. But where did those friends and followers come from in the first place? The communities you’re in! (Note: Networks and audience are really important for the minimalist entrepreneur , just not yet. W e’ll cover them deeply in Chapter Five.) Eventually , you will be part of various networks as the face of your business, but at the beginning, beware of believing that communities and networks are interchangable, no 29",275

[INSER T ART5] [head A] Contribute, create, and teach Being a member of a community is a start, but the real magic happens when you start to contribute. Authors and bloggers Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba call this the “1% rule”: on the internet, they say , 1% create, 9% contribute, and 90% consume. They’ve shown this rule to be true when applied to sites like Wikipedia and Yahoo, and it’ s also 26 widely applicable to other collaborative websites. For example, most people do not post, comment, or even upvote on Reddit like Sol Orwell and Kurtis Frank did.

If you contribute, you will have ten times the presence of someone who doesn’t. And it will continue to grow from there. [INSER T ART6] Contributing means commenting, editing, and generally being part of the broader conversation. What’ s more, if you go further and create by showing what you’re working on, teaching what you’re learning, and bringing new material to your community , that influence will grow to 90x. Of course, I am simplifying, but hopefully the point stands: while it’ s better to lurk rather than needlessly comment, it’s even better to add value into the community even if you don’t feel that you’re ready . If you struggle with this, as many do, remind yourself that if you have something to add, it’ s selfish to keep it to yourself! Once you start contributing, folks will start recognizing your name. Eventually , some may seek your words of wisdom by “@mention”ing you directly or by following you so they get notified every time you post. When I lived in Utah, I met several painters who built communities and eventually businesses in this way . One example is landscape oil painter Bryan Mark Taylor , who was part of a community of painters and art enthusiasts participating in and attending 31",340
Page 32,"plein air painting competitions up and down the California coastline. He sold his work through these competitions and established a loyal following of collectors and fellow artists, who followed him to Instagram. There he grew his community by posting more of his work and educational videos. When his easel broke on a backpacking trip in the early 2010s, he created the first prototype of the Strada Easel to solve his own problem. And because his community had grown organically over a period of years and through a shared passion, he had thousands of other painters he could share it with who then wanted one for themselves. Today , the Strada Easel makes him and his employees a happy living, and he gets to paint as much as he wants. Once you’re regularly cultivating relationships by contributing to the conversation, the time will come when you’re ready to go further and to educate others. But what will you say and how will you engage the people you’ve come to know and respect in your community? It’ s all about creating value and can all be summed up by three signs Nathan Barry , the founder of ConvertKit, which provides email marketing for creators, has hanging in his of fice. They read: W ork in Public, Teach Everything You Know , and Create Every Day . If you’re always learning, then you’ll always have a way to show 27 what you’re doing and to teach others about their own next best steps. When Nathan started blogging and publishing ebooks in 2006, he struggled to grow the community for his work while others in his space seemed to have no trouble. One web designer he followed was Chris Coyier , who was regularly posting articles and tutorials on his website, CSS-tricks.com. Chris had a following based on his articles, and in 2012 when he needed $3500 for living expenses to take a month of f to redesign his site, he promised recorded tutorials about the redesign process in exchange for a contribution to his Kickstarter campaign. In short order , Chris raised $87,000. “I couldn’t help but think how Chris and I had equal skill sets when it came to web design,” Nathan writes. “We started at the same time and progressed at the same rate. So how did Chris have the ability to flip the switch and make $87,000 of f a Kickstarter campaign and I didn’t have the ability at all? What was the dif ference?” They were both doing the work, but Chris was sharing, while Nathan was not. “I realized I would take on a project, do the work, deliver the project and move on,” he said. “Chris did the same thing, BUT before he moved on, he would teach about everything he learned doing that project. When he could, he shared samples, he wrote tutorials about 27 000 Create Every Day : Nathan Barry, Twitter Post, March 26, 2016, 10:29 AM, https://twitter.com/nathanbarry/status/713734553257390080 32",641

Chances are, if you've learned something, there is probably a good portion of your community that would find value in learning that from you, even if you aren't the world's leading authority on the subject. And if you are regularly learning, then you’ll always have regular content to contribute to the community . This can become a nice flywheel over time, as teaching often becomes the best way to drive your own curiosity and inspiration to learn more yourself. And when you learn publicly , your students will have questions that force you to learn more stuff to teach them.

For example, Patrick McKenzie, a writer , entrepreneur , and software business expert who is best known for a 2012 post on salary negotiation that has since become a cult classic in the software engineering space, believes that the best personal brands 29 exist at the intersection of two topics. He now works for Stripe, where he continues to write and advise software engineers and software entrepreneurs about how to start and scale their businesses, speaking from real experience as a creator and business owner himself. 30 If you’re learning every day , which you probably are, you’ll have something to share every day . Meanwhile, you’ll build your skills and experience, learn to speak the language, and grow your community , all essential ingredients when you eventually have a product you are ready to sell. Unfortunately , as you probably already know , there are no shortcuts. As you think about what you’re creating now and how that might lead to a business in the future, look to the communities you’re already a part of. You’ve invested time and energy there, so perhaps you already have an idea of how to proceed. If you don’t, keep going, and continue using your time to get strong, to learn how to paint, to learn how to code, to learn how to write, or to learn whatever else you are into, teaching what you’re learning along the way . When you are proficient enough to monetize what you know , now or in the future, if you’ve put in the time, you will be part of a sizable community that will eventually be your first group of prospective customers (more on that in Chapters 4 and 5). This is an important factor in keeping you honest about the quality of work you are able to produce. Your community should serve as proof that you’re improving, producing, and helping others; these people could spend their attention on a gazillion things, and they’ve chosen you. Becoming a person who helps people precedes building a business that helps people. It’s not a coincidence. When you become a pillar in a community , you gain exposure to the problems that the people within it face. People will come to you for help, explain their problems to you, and ask for your help in solving them.

Page 35,"Overnight success is a myth It took me a long time – until writing this book! – to realize how important communities were to my career . The Gumroad origin story I tell starts with me working as an early engineer at Pinterest. A few months in, on a Friday night, I was at home learning how to design a photorealistic icon for a side project. I came up with this: [INSER T ART8] I spent four hours, if I recall correctly . But if I had had a source file to work from, something to see how all the shadows and highlights and shapes came together , it would have taken me half that time. I would have totally paid money for that, at least a buck. And because I was part of a community of like-minded designers, I knew many others would too. Not only that, but a subset of those designers followed me directly on Twitter – all potential customers. I looked around online, assuming it was going to be incredibly easy to sell something digital to my audience, but it wasn’t. It would have required setting up a whole storefront and paying a monthly fee. I had stubbed my toe on a problem -- a concept we’ll explore in more detail later in this chapter . I built Gumroad that weekend, launched it Monday morning, and even sold a few copies of that pencil icon. But the classic origin story is incomplete. It turns out I had had a similar problem and thought process before, but I hadn’t decided to build Gumroad then. In a blog post from 2012, I wrote about trying unsuccessfully to find a way to sell the source code for a Twitter client app I build for the iPhone. I searched for a solution for a few hours, but I couldn’t find anything and gave up. A lot had changed in the years between the first time I imagined what would eventually become Gumroad and the second time, but the most important shift was that I had found my communities and had established myself within them by creating, contributing, learning, and teaching. When I had the idea the second time around, I was armed with 35",439
Page 36,"the confidence, audience, and insights to solve a meaningful problem quickly and effectively . From the outside, it all seems so straightforward, but it took time not only to become part of the community but also to choose the community I wanted to serve and to decide on the problem I wanted to solve. There’ s really no such thing as overnight success. Most are years in the making, just like my ability to build Gumroad over a weekend was also many years in the works. When I was just getting started with web design, parents and teachers were my first clients (a social studies teacher needed a website for her books, while a parent needed help with the online presence of a local charity auction). Over time, I found like-minded web designers on web forums like TalkFreelance, self-described as a “forum for web designers and freelance developers” interested in website design, programming, search engine optimization, and more. Later , I found Hacker News, a site where most of Silicon Valley congregated online. At first, I was a “lurker ,” then a commenter , and then an active contributor . And because my Twitter account was in my profile, as well as in my email signature, I started to collect a small following of people who signalled their interest in following me ! Communities were essential for my personal development and my career growth. They were where I made friends and formed business relationships. To this day , I am still meeting people who remember my name or handle from those years. I never had an agenda. I just knew I wanted to be part of Hacker News. And with their help, when I launched Gumroad that first Monday morning, it rocketed to the top of the frontpage of the site, and stayed there all day . Even though that was just the beginning of my story , it was still confirmation that I had found my people and I was where I belonged. [INSER T ART9] 36",403
Page 37,"[head A] Picking the right community Once you are part of a community , you can start to make a list of dif ficulties they face, and you can think about how you could build a product or service to solve one or more of them. Every community has a unique set of problems that’ s calling out for a custom-built solution. You’re probably part of a number of communities, but when it comes to making an impact in a community in a way that leads to a minimalist business, you should focus on a community where you can (and want to): 1) create long term value; 2) build relationships for decades to come; and 3) carve out a unique, authentic voice for yourself. For the minimalist entrepreneur trying to make an impact, community is a way to stay focused: instead of changing the world, you can change your community’ s world. 37",190
Page 38,"It’s not enough to pick any community; you also have to consider your own interests. There are many communities that you may be a part of, but that doesn’t mean you want to dedicate a significant portion of your waking hours to solving their problems. Unless some element of the community and its problems overlap with something you’re passionate about, it is unlikely you would be happy operating a business within the space–contempt for your customers is not optimal. There are two more important attributes that will decide which is the ideal community to focus on: how large the community is, and how much money they are willing to spend (said dif ferently: the total addressable market, or “TAM”). The goal here is not to find the largest community with the most dollars to spend in order to capture 1% of it. Instead, you should find something right in the middle. Too small, and you won’t be able to build a sustainable business. Too large, and it will cost too much money to get to sustainability in the first place–and you will attract or create competitors along the way , leading to a race to the bottom in product pricing you may not survive. The best way to win is to be the only . And the best way to be the only is to pick a group that is “Goldilocks”-sized, has problems they would pay money to solve, and is underserved (likely because it is too small for larger competitors to go after). Tope Awotona, founder of Calendly , started three very different companies for three completely dif ferent communities before eventually building the scheduling software business in 2013. In 2020, Calendly posted nearly $70 million in annual recurring revenue, more than double its 2019 figure. But his first company was a dating app that 31 never really got of f the ground. The second was projectorspot.com, which sold (obviously) projectors, but sales were poor and margins small. He tried again with a third startup selling grills, but as he says, “ I didn’t know anything about grills and I didn’t want to! I lived in an apartment, and never even grilled.” Not only was he not part of the grilling community , he didn’t even want to be! 32 He took a dif ferent approach to building Calendly . He had been a sales rep earlier in his career , and he knew the hassle of having to send multiple emails to schedule meetings. He had even stubbed his toe on the scheduling problem while trying to sell his own products as an entrepreneur . As time went on and his other ideas failed to gain traction, he saw a gap in the marketplace and resolved to address it for the community of sales reps he cared about and understood. He says, “the journey to creating something that's impactful, something that serves people, something that you know people are willing to open up their wallets and pay for - is not something that you can do just for money .” 32 000 even want to be : Karen Houghton, “Tope Awotona - A Founder Story,” Atlanta Tech Village (blog), April 26, 2018, https://atlantatechvillage.com/buzz/2018/04/26/tope-awotona-a-founder-story/. 31 000 double its 2019 figure : Lucinda Shen, “Meet the Unicorn Founder That Braved War Zones and Missed Meetings to Make His Mark on the Startup World,” Fortune , November 24, 2020, https://fortune.com/2020/11/19/calendly-founder-tope-awotona-startup-unicorn/. 38",787
Page 39,"While lots of people have scheduling fatigue, Awotona focused on problems specific to sales reps, which helped him define a problem he could both solve and monetize. 33 What does that mean for you? First, pick the things you're authentically passionate about. Next, get involved in those communities wherever they are, of fline and online. Then, exchange ideas and most importantly listen. Finally , use the filters above to make sure you are picking the right community to serve. Then, your problem becomes: Which problem should I pick? [Head A] Picking the right problem to solve The late Clayton Christensen describes picking the right problem to solve as an opportunity to help customers achieve what they hope to achieve in a particular moment. “What [great companies] really need to home in on,” he wrote in a 2016 article for Harvard Business Review , “is the progress that the customer is trying to make in a given circumstance—what the customer hopes to accomplish: the job to be done,” he says. 34 For example, millions of people buy McDonalds’ milkshakes. Why? Because McDonald’ s found out that the job to be done was to accompany lonely drivers on their trips to work. “Nearly half the milkshakes were sold in the very early morning. It was the only thing [the customers] bought, they were always alone, and they always got in the car and drove of f with it.” This is one reason why McDonald’ s milkshakes are so 35 viscous: so they last a whole, lonely car ride. Now, the McDonalds marketing team can go into an of fice and create a problem that could potentially only be solved by their food. Then, they can spend hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising to convince people that they have this problem, and that they too could “hire” a milkshake to get the job done. Christensen's idea of ""the job to be done"" is sound, but McDonald’ s is doing it in the wrong order . They didn't start with the customer; they started with the job to be done, and then sank a ton of money into making customers believe they needed that job to be done. 35 000 drove off with it : Clayton M.

Page 40,"Minimalist entrepreneurs don’t have millions of dollars, nor do they want to manufacture problems for people. Instead, we believe that people already have enough problems, and that our role is to help them get rid of one. That is why it is so key to start with community . If you try to make something for everyone, you will likely end up making something that no one really wants or needs. Best case, you sink millions in marketing dollars to convince potential customers that they do want or need your product. But constraints, such as who you choose to build for, lead to creativity . Once you know the group of people you want to help, you will start to see their problems much more readily . There are more problems than businesses. You just have to find them. Be present, live your life, and watch for every little thing that snaps you – or anyone in your community – out of flow . For example, if there is a task that you file away to do later when you have more willpower , or a thing you have to run to the store for , or an interaction with someone or something that you are dreading. Still struggling? Grab a pen and paper . On the left, write down the person/community you would like to help.

Page 42,"Remember , you are not trying to create problems for people in order to solve them à la McDonalds. You are trying to discover inef ficiencies in the lives of people you care about, so you can help them. For example, a business that takes cof fee beans in Ecuador and sells them in San Francisco is changing the “place” property of the beans. “Place utility” is what you are paying the premium for . If a cof fee shop buys beans from a wholesaler and grinds them up, their customers are paying a premium for “form utility .” (Caveat: They are also, in theory , paying a premium for “place utility” if the cof fee shop is closer to them than the distributor is. Of course, many businesses are a combination of a few .) If they also sell croissants that would take you three days to make, you are also paying a premium for time utility . Finally , if you decide it’ s better for you to invest in a croissant-maker to make your own croissants than paying for them over and over again, that’s possession utility . 42",249
Page 43,"These may sound abstract, so let’ s put the four types of utility in context. One business that provides time utility is The Cut, an app which connects barbers and clients and makes it faster and easier to find, book, and pay for services. Founders Obi Omile and Kush Patel came up with the idea after spending hours struggling to find barbers they liked and trusted. And getting an appointment with the best barbers often meant waiting hours because many used informal booking systems. The Cut provides utility for both sides. Clients save time, and barbers find new clients (possession utility), spend less time communicating with current ones (time utility), and receive mobile payments (form utility). 36 Omile and Patel built a great business because they understood the problems that plagued the community they planned to serve.

Basecamp had their own version of this moment, when they were struggling to find the right tool to manage products with their clients. As founder Jason Fried says, “we went looking for a tool to do this. What we found were ancient relics. To us, project management was all about communication. None of the software makers at the time seemed to agree. So we decided to make our own.” 37 When they launched, they were already an essential part of the online product management and web design community , with a well-read blog and dozens of clients. How did this help them? In Jason’ s words: “W e decided early on that if we were able to generate around $5000/month after a year (or about $60,000 in annual revenue), we’d have a good thing going. Turns out, we hit that number in about six weeks. So we absolutely were on to something.” When they had something ready to show their community , it turned out 38 that many members had encountered the same roadblock. If you have a problem, other people probably do, too. Like many chefs, Nick Kokonas regularly faced the issue of lost revenue from no-shows at his Chicago restaurants. In a bid to solve his own problem, he co-founded Tock, which manages demand through traditional reservations but also through ticketing, which allows diners to pre-pay for reservations and special events and permits restaurants to create “demand pricing” based on the desirability of reservation times. Prior to 2020, Tock was in 30 countries, 39 200 cities, and in use by thousands of restaurants including some of the world’ s best. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Tock innovated further by launching Tock to Go, which allows customers to reserve and purchase restaurant meals for pickup from restaurants that may not have of fered takeout or delivery ever before. 40 All of these businesses and many , many more hark back to community as a starting point.

[head A] Building the right solution Most businesses do not work, even if they are solving a real problem. This is often because while they are building something people want, they are not building it in the right way with the right minimalist mindset. So what kind of business can you build without a dollar of venture capital, appropriate to your skills and resources, in line with your mission, and viable in the marketplace? It is also important to ask: If your business achieves its potential, what kind of positive impact might it make on the world? That, not the lure of an IPO, should be the guiding light for the founders of a company and all of its employees. These are the criteria I use: [checklist] ❏ Will I love it? Building a business is hard and time-consuming. It will take years. And the more successful it is, the longer you will work on it. So it’ s important to find something you want to work on, for people you want to work for . To build a successful business, you need to build something people love. To stick with it, you need to build something you love working on. I call this business-you fit; it will keep you going. ❏ Will it be inherently monetizable? There should be a clear path to charging people money for something of value, in a way that feels obvious. If it makes sense, it’ll make cents. ❏ Does it have an internal growth mechanism? In 2020, Gumroad’ s revenues almost doubled due solely to word-of-mouth. In our case, it’ s impossible to use the product without sharing it with other people, and as a result, we’ve been able to “outsource” our sales and marketing ef forts because our customer base does the work for us as their customers use our platform. This is true of a lot of minimalist businesses, especially because you’re going to build a great product people want to tell others about, and that they may eventually want to use themselves. ❏ Do I have the right natural skill sets to build this business? For example, if the business requires a lot of business development or sales calls to get of f the ground, and you are deathly scared of speaking to anyone, then it's probably not a good fit for you. There are a lot of businesses waiting to be built–pick the right one for you. 46",543
Page 47,"No one book contains everything you’ll need to know for starting any kind of business. The important thing is the thought process you bring to figuring things out for yourself. You need the right mindset and to know what questions to ask yourself. It begins and ends by thinking of your business as a tool to solve a customer ’s problem. Not as a lottery ticket. [head A] Squashing your doubts Finally , even though you have an idea you are excited about and are confident you can build, at some point, you will have doubts. Surround yourself with colleagues and mentors who will not only tell you the truth but who will also encourage you when the going gets tough. After all, people need cheerleaders, not just advice. Inspiring (and inspired) founders and leaders are not born, they are made. Almost anyone can do it, with enough patience, guidance, and sincerity . Mileage will get you far in life. A minimalist business can meet you where you are. It can grow with you, as you grow . I would be lying if I said talent didn’t matter at all, but what truly makes great founders and great businesses in the long-term is a great deal of persistence. And one way to maximize your chances of success is to focus on a smaller product, on a community you are a core part of, and to be honest about if you are solving the problem ef fectively or not. That's why a mindful approach to selling to a community you already have a relationship with is so important. When you have doubts, and you will have doubts, go back to the fact that you’ve done the work. By now , you will have (1) zeroed in on a mission-aligned problem to solve and (2) generated feasible ideas for a bootstrapped business that can tackle that problem profitably and sustainably . CBInsights notes that 42% of startups note “no market need” as the number one reason their startup failed. This happens when you try to build a business without community 41 backing. It is like shouting into an empty cave; it rarely works. If you do not have relationships with potential customers, you are going to have to pay for them. And when you go straight to spending money on networks like Facebook and Google ads in hopes of reaching them, you are likely to fail.

Build a manual valuable process first [epi] Make something people want. – Y Combinator 42 Make something people want. – Me The previous chapter was all about finding a problem worth solving for people worth solving for . Now we’re going to talk about zeroing in on the smallest stumbling block imaginable, creating a simple, repeatable solution, and building it in a scalable way . In this chapter , I explain how to develop your idea and, more importantly , how to figure out what you need to do now versus what can wait until you’re in business. Knowledge is important, but so is momentum. You don’t want to get so in the weeds on which programming language to learn that you never start making your dream app. Especially at the beginning, minimalist entrepreneurs have to stick to what is truly essential rather than trying to learn and do everything all at once. While writers are often told to “write what you know ,” for entrepreneurs, the process isn’t so simple. When you’re starting a business, you’re often imagining something—a product, a service, a business model—that’ s never been tried before. That said, most successful minimalist entrepreneurs have a solid background (or interest) in one aspect of the business they’re starting even if they don’t know everything about it or exactly how to begin. For me, it was simple: pretty , accessible software. When the iPhone App Store launched in 2008, I was one of its first wave of developers. Not because I was determined to start a business, but because I was following my passions and curiosity . Unfortunately , in my conversations with aspiring founders, this point is where most folks decide that building a business is not for them. They have the passion, but they let self-doubt creep in, persuading themselves that they don’t possess the hard skills they think they need, such as iOS programming or financial modeling. But remember , many entrepreneurs have built successful mobile apps without knowing how to program on day one. This is about interests, not skills. Instead of focusing on the things you do not know , focus on the things you do. You do not need a team, money , or a degree to start building.

Gát felt that a great cultural shift was happening, and she was eager to be part of creating the way the world would look in the years to come. It was a bold idea, but she had accomplished a similarly challenging task several years before as co-founder of Hungary’ s leading women’ s rights website and events community , for which she won a Glamour W oman of the Year Award.

What she was building simply wasn’t scalable. Her second version of the product, a messaging app that would facilitate public discourse through AI, was even more ambitious. For two years, she poured all of her energy , money , and time into building a new platform, working nights and spending every dollar she had to fund testing and development. Unfortunately , as the product moved closer to launch, many people who had said they would use the app were not as interested as they had indicated in preliminary research. “I was hellbent on building technology ,” she says, and the whole endeavor had been so expensive and time consuming that she was reluctant to abandon it. But in the meantime, she was organizing in-person salons where people could share their opinions and ideas. She didn’t consider these gatherings to be a business, but she couldn’t help but see that she had inadvertently created the vibrant, intellectual community she had been seeking--it was just happening through the salons rather than through the app. Her entire career had been in tech, so building a company with zero tech felt counterintuitive to her . She abandoned the app anyway and pursued what she felt was the “grander” idea based on the energy and fun she felt in the salon community . Now Interintellect is growing sustainably and realizing her initial dreams by way of a low tech, systematized solution that reflects what her customers want and need. Later in this chapter , we’ll talk more about Interintellect, but I get why so many people start with software or technology when building a business. I love it too, but it’ s far too constricting at the beginning of the creative process. It makes the stakes too high, and it’s too serious, expensive, and stressful! That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t use engineering strategies to get started. It’ s just that you don’t have to jump straight into coding or programming to create the processes that will power your minimalist business. The world will tell you to go big or go home, but I say go small at the beginning. And the smallest you could possibly start is to build nothing at all. Instead of skipping straight to software, stick with pen and paper . [head A] Start with process Every big idea was small first. If you don’t start small, if you can’t help people one-by-one, you are going to struggle to build a business around your idea. Leave your ego at the door , set aside your concerns about funding and software, and focus on your first customers, using your time and your expertise to solve real problems for real people. 51",591
Page 52,"Now that people know you, trust you, and perhaps even turn to you for expertise, it is time to start helping them in a systematic, repeatable way that allows for continuous improvement and iteration. As you fulfill the first customer cycle, document each part of the process so that with every consecutive customer you have a playbook. This document will be the true MVP of your business. I’m not talking about the minimum viable product that we’re all trying to build and to launch. I’m talking about the manual valuable process that precedes it and will be the foundation for the business you’re trying to build. Methodically creating this manual viable process and recording the steps you take to complete it will help you figure out what’ s working and what isn’t. It will also help you discover if you’re making something that people actually need or will buy . In his book, Anything You W ant , CD Baby founder Derek Sivers writes, “If you want to make a movie recommendation service, start by telling friends to call you for movie recommendations. When you find a movie your friends like, they buy you a drink. Keep track of what you recommended and how your friends liked it, and improve from there.” 43 Unfortunately , the English language does not have a word for this activity , so I made one up: verb processize [excerpt] 1 to turn into a process: After they tested it on their friends, they processized their recommendation system. [end excerpt] It really should, because it is so important in the path to building a business the right way. Perhaps this is why so many people miss this step, falter , and ultimately fail. If you go straight from problem to product, you may build before learning exactly what and how to build, but processizing is a cheap, quick, discovery process. “Creating a product is a process of discovery , not mere implementation. Technology is applied science,” Naval Ravikant says. 44 Without processization, you may think you know what the customer actually wants, maybe even because the customer has told you what they want, and maybe even what they would pay for . But as Anna Gát can tell us, talk is cheap. Until you get through the 44 000 Naval Ravikant says : Naval Ravikant (navalr), “ Creating a product is a process of discovery , not mere implementation.

You need to solve one customer ’s problem reasonably well, if imperfectly , before you can scale. If it works, great. If it doesn’t, you may realize you want to scale up, but your customers couldn’t care less. If that’ s the case, you may want to consider a different idea. One minimalist business built on process is endcrawl.com. For eight years, founder John “Pliny” Eremic ran a post-production company for the film industry and watched filmmakers struggle to produce the end credits that listed all of the people, places, and organizations that appeared in or contributed to the making of a film. He and his co-founder , Alan Grow , knew there had to be a better way, and the obvious answer was some kind of software to manage the endless changes and updates that made the process so painful. But they didn’t start there; instead, they set up a Google sheet and a simple Perl script to build end credits to help them learn about their customers and validate some of their core assumptions. Their initial process looked like this: 45 [bullet] ● Give customers a Google Sheet with their end credits formatted to their specifications. ● Customers could edit the Google Sheet as often and as much as they liked. ● Once they wanted a new “render” or video output of the credits, they e-mailed the request. ● Pliny or Alan manually exported their Google Sheet to CSV . ● Then, they manually ran the CSV through the Perl script. ● Next, they manually uploaded the files to Dropbox. ● Finally , they manually emailed the customer the download link. For filmmakers used to waiting up to 24 hours, it was a revelation that this process, even manually , took only about 15 minutes. It also allowed the customers to control their data and to do an unlimited number of revisions for a fixed price until the credits were 45 000 some of their core assumptions : John Eremic, “Growing a SaaS App for the Film Industry With Rigorous Experimentation,” Indie Hackers, Accessed October 18, 2020, https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/growing-a-saas-app-for-the-film-industry-with-rigorous-experiment ation-8aa8348dae. 53",528

[head A] Build last Even after you help your first few customers, you might not be totally sure how to solve the problem you have chosen to solve for your community , but one of the easiest ways to get started and to experiment is to freelance. Selling your time does not scale nearly as well as other types of businesses but can generate positive cash flow much sooner , giving you the breathing room to think about what comes next.

In my experience, many of the best minimalist businesses start out as freelance work or side projects before evolving into viable companies with potential for long term growth. As you consider what exactly to build, there are a few routes that will get you to a profitable, sustainable business in the quickest, most ef ficient way . They are: [bullet] - Selling your knowledge and teaching people via digital content (videos, ebooks, podcasts, and courses) - Lynda.com, which LinkedIn acquired in 2015, grew from a book and a series of in-person workshops led by L ynda Weinman. When the dot.com bubble burst in 2001, L ynda and her husband, Bruce Heavin, of fered a subscription service to the online educational videos they made about web design, an idea that was new at the time. At first it seemed that the business would not survive, but as L ynda.com’ s subscribers grew from just a few hundred to hundreds of thousands, their industry impact also expanded astronomically . 47 - Selling a physical product (merchandise or a unique product offering) - Noxgear manufactures light-up visibility vests for runners and cyclists. The idea first came to cofounders Tom W alters and Simon Curran when they patched together a version of what would eventually become the Tracer360 for their nighttime ultimate frisbee games. When they looked into what was available in the marketplace for early morning and late night athletes, they saw an opportunity , prototyped their product, and sold the first 500 vests on Kickstarter . They’ve since added the Lighthound, a light-up harness for dogs. 48 - Connecting people for a flat or percentage fee - Craig Newmark started Craigslist as an email list among his friends, highlighting local events in the San Francisco Bay Area worth checking out. Today , they are doing over $1 billion in revenue per year , with fewer than 100 employees. But while Craigslist is the quintessential example of connecting people, there are many ways to do this. Job boards, like People First Jobs (which we discuss in Chapter 7 on Culture and Hiring), connect companies with candidates, often charging a flat fee for doing 48 000 a light-up harness for dogs : Elizabeth Kyle, “Dayton Startup Profile: High Visibility Vest Makes International Impact,” Dayton Business Journal , November 5, 2019, https://www.bizjournals.com/dayton/news/2019/11/05/dayton-startup-profile-high-visibility-vest-makes.html . 47 000 their industry impact also expanded astronomically : Jane Porter, “From Near Failure To A $1.5 Billion Sale: The Epic Story Of Lynda.com,” Fast Company , April 27, 2015, https://www.fastcompany.com/3045404/from-near-failure-to-a-15-billion-sale-the-epic-story-of-lyndacom. 55",669
Page 56,"so. And there are communities too, like Product Manager HQ, that connect like-minded folks with each other . - Software as a service (SaaS) - The idea of building a software solution that would optimize remote work and minimize distractions came to Justin Mitchell and his team at YAC in 2018. They built the first iteration of what would eventually become their asynchronous voice messaging app in four days for Product Hunt’ s Maker ’s Festival because they saw a hole in the market for remote workers who were constantly dealing with the demands of Zoom meetings and the distraction of Slack. Although YAC’s platform, integrations, 49 and features have grown since then, it all began with the small idea of eliminating interruptions. In the last chapter we covered the four dif ferent kinds of economic utility: form, time, place, and possession utility . To come up with your offering, you’ll likely overlay that list onto the list above to come up with the type of business that best solves the problem you’re trying to solve for your customers. For example, you may save people time (time utility) learning a new skill with an online, cohort-based course (digital content). Or you may build software (form utility) that automates a manual, physical process (SaaS). Over time, your business will likely of fer two or more of these products and services, but at first, you should pick one to focus on and get started. Generally , that should be the one that lets you begin today , instead of tomorrow . Remember that you don’t have to know everything about what you’re doing at the beginning (or ever), and many people are wrong the first time about what they are building. The fact is that it’ s very likely that you discover the kind of business you should be building as you are building another business you thought you should be building. As Adam W athan of TailwindUI says, “W ant to find a good SaaS idea? Start a business, literally any business. You will soon realize how bad every existing tool is that you have to pay for to run that business, and you will quickly become overwhelmed by the number of things you feel you need to build yourself.” 50 If you make a false start, just go back, reset, and begin again. Nothing you’ve done or learned is ever wasted. A sustainable, growing business will take years to fully develop, and because you are growing as the business wishes you to, you have the time to make adjustments and to learn the skills you need to know to succeed at each step. That’ s because you are not doing this the unicorn-way , which the venture capitalist Marc Andreesen refers to as “baking a cake in three minutes.” You are using your slow cooker to make a soup, on low heat and in full view . 50 000 you need to build yourself : Adam Wathan, Twitter Post, May 14, 2020, 8:38 AM, https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1260912251566985223. 49 000 and the distraction of Slack : Peter Fritz, interview with Justin Mitchell, Office Anywhere, podcast audio, April 13, 2020, https://peterfritz.co/voice-messaging-beats-slack-zoom-yac-justin-mitchell/ 56",711
Page 57,"And if you’re not rushing, you have time to talk to customers, time to iterate, and time to test your hypothesis. [head a] Test your hypothesis A business hypothesis is just like the one you learn in fifth grade science class. It is a suggested solution for a problem that does not currently have a solution. It must be testable--able to be tested repeatedly and independently--and falsifiable--able to be proven wrong). For example: my customers will pay a fixed fee with a small premium to get their end credits quickly and efficiently produced with as many renders as they need . Every business starts by testing a hypothesis with real customers. And if you only have one customer , you can treat your startup like a whiteglove service. This may mean a phone call or sitting across the table from your customer at a local cof fee shop, helping them with their problem. The goal of these meetings is to validate this hypothesis. This takes time to test and honest reflection to recognize when you are wrong. But it is better to be wrong now , when the stakes are low , than to be wrong after you have spent five years and some of your own personal capital trying to build your idea into a business that was never meant to exist. When you are validating a hypothesis, do not ask leading questions–questions which point people to the answer you want to hear . Instead, think about creating the kind of feedback loop that author and tech entrepreneur Rob Fitzpatrick, writes about in The Mom T est . When you ask the kind of questions he recommends, the kind even your mom can’t lie to you about, you will get the honest truth because no one will know that you have a new idea for a business and that you’re testing to see if it’ s viable. For example, you shouldn’t ask: [ext] Would you pay for my product? [end ext] Instead, ask: [ext] Why haven’t you been able to fix this already? [end ext] 57",421
Page 58,"There are many businesses that cannot be proven in this way , but these are not the types of businesses we are interested in building. We’re aiming to build businesses that are testable at a small scale, and can then be scaled up gradually , over time. Another benefit of this approach: you can charge for it. If you are genuinely helping someone, you do not need to wait until you have a product to sell in order to make money . You can be paid for your time like Pliny and Alan were even before they technically had a “product.” In their case, the process they created proved their hypothesis that filmmakers would pay for a solution to the problem of trying to finish the credits. Your first idea may not go as smoothly , and that is totally okay – most experiments are wrong. You are at the frontier , literally trying to make something that does not exist yet, and you will be wrong a lot on the way to figuring out what your customers want. As long as you are working toward being right through processization, you only have to be right once. And when you do arrive there, you will have a document that dictates your perfect process because as you’ve walked someone through solving their problem, you’ve refined the steps it takes to get there. This process is the foundation for your future product, service, or other of fering, and it will take future customers from nothing to something. It’ s something you can share (perhaps publish). You haven’t made any money . You don’t necessarily have a business yet . But you’ve provided what Paul Graham, the founder of Y Combinator among many other things, calls a “quantum of utility: when there is at least some set of users who would be excited to hear about it, because they can now do something they couldn’t do before.” 51 [INSER T ART15] 51 000 “something they couldn’t do before” : John Gruber, “A Quantum of Utility,” Daring Fireball , Accessed February 6, 2021, https://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/04/02/utility-paul-graham. 58",468
Page 59,"[head A] Do one thing well Before I launched into research or coding or brand building, I picked a single problem to solve for myself and for my community of creators: selling digital files to their audiences. The basic assumption was simple, that people were starting their careers on the internet, some of them finding enormous success through social media rather than with websites and blogs. But at the end of the day , when they needed a platform to sell what they were making, they still wanted somewhere to send people and a streamlined way to deliver digital files and get paid for them. At its start, like any good product, Gumroad really only did one thing. The original Gumroad website reads: [num list; PE: retain bold] 1. Take a file or a link of value. This can be anything. From a link to an exclusive build of an app, to a secret blog post, to an icon you spent hours designing. 59",194
Page 60,"2. Share it. Just like any old link. Choose your own price. You don't have to create a store. And you don't have to do any management. 3. Make money . And that's it. At the end of each month we'll deposit the money you've earned to your PayPal account. If you think building an app like that is insanely complicated, it may be useful to know that most apps on the internet consist of two things: forms and lists. Twitter , for example, has a form you use to tweet (with a single input) and a list of tweets you see from people you follow . These apps are referred to as “CRUD” apps, as they have four actions you can take: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. And Twitter doesn’t even let you edit tweets! Gumroad fit this model. At first, I let a creator create, edit, and delete products, and allowed consumers to view them (“read” them). Stripe made payments easy to take, and PayPal made it easy for payouts to be sent out (albeit manually , at first). Gumroad didn't have file uploading at the time (you had to specify a destination URL post-purchase, like a YouTube URL), and I didn't even have automated payouts or fee calculations. That was all manual. The whole app was 2,700 lines of mostly copy-pasted code in a single Python file, hosted on Google's cloud. But it worked! It solved the problem. So I launched. Of course, it wasn't ""ready"" for the masses, but almost ten years later , Gumroad still doesn't feel ready . I don’t think it ever will be. Wait a second, no payouts? Nope! Instead, I collected everyone's PayPal information. At the end of every month, I made a list of everyone's email addresses and their account balances, and paid everyone out one-by-one. Eventually , I started to automate bits of it. Instead of copy-pasting lines from the database, I wrote some code to download a list. Later , I wrote a script that would issue the payouts using PayPal's API. There were still issues. For example, whether you made a sale on August 1st or August 30th, you would still be paid out on August 31st, meaning it could easily become an attack vector for fraudsters who could make a bunch of sales a few minutes right before they’re meant to be paid out, circumventing our ability to block the transaction. Later , we added a seven-day buf fer, though we got away with not having any buf fer for at least a year or two. Over time, we automated absolutely everything, which made all the dif ference when I needed to run the ship single-handedly . But we didn't start there! First, I ""hired"" myself to do it. Then, I built a process around it. Then we turned parts of it into a product, now wholly automated. In the next section I’ll talk more about how we did it. 60",648
Page 61,"[head A] What should I build? To this day , processizing is a concept we employ over and over again at Gumroad. Everything I do is listed on a piece of paper that everyone can access. When I go on vacation, someone else can take over my job. And if I get hit by a bus, the company doesn’t go under . Once you have this magic piece of paper , you can turn your process into a product. W e don’t have to make up a new word for this, because it already exists: productizing. “Productizing'' is the process of developing a process into something you can sell. In the processizing stage, you created a manual valuable process for yourself and built a system for working ef ficiently and ef fectively as you sold to each individual customer . Now you are ready to productize, which means that you automate each of these individual tasks so that people can sign up, use, and pay for your product without you being involved. If processizing is how you scale a manual process, then productizing is how you go fully automatic. Just like a brick and mortar business in your local community needs some essentials to get up and running, you will need to do the same for your minimalist business. And if you have to go back a few steps, don't worry because that's part of the process too. [INSER T ART16] 61",299
Page 62,"[bullet; PE: preserve bold] ● Name your business - Before you can tell anyone about your product, you need a name. I like names that take two words and combine them, because I find them easier to remember than a new , made-up word. I also think they help with word of mouth, because everyone will know how to spell them. This is also called a “radio test:” if someone hears your business’ s name on the radio, can they find it using Google? Gumroad, Dropbox, and Facebook follow this model. But honestly , your name doesn’t matter much. Take it from the founder of Gumroad. If you’re successful, your name will feel right. ● Build a website - The equivalent of your brick and mortar store is a website. To do that, you need to buy a domain; it will cost you about $10 (renewing yearly). Connect it to a website building platform like Carrd, Gumroad, Wix, or something 62",216
Page 63,"else. These will cost about $10 a month. Create an email address for yourself with that domain ( sahil@gumroad.com , for example), as well as a password manager . ● Create social media accounts - You’ll need two sets of accounts, one for you personally and one for your business (you’ll see why in the chapter on marketing). ● Make it easy for customers to pay - Get a Square or Stripe account. These are payment processors that will help you collect credit card payments online and in person. They are free to sign up for and cost about 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction. Now your business is ready to accept your first customer . If someone asks you what you are working on, you can give them a URL they can check out (if not checkout!). At the beginning, you should use it to explain what your product does and provide an email for folks who may be interested in such a thing, even if you do not have a product yet. You can and should always be learning and interacting with prospective customers. Once you have these in place, you can start building. But what exactly to build? As little as you can. W e'll get into launching in the next chapter , but this chapter is about building. That means you need to start shipping, and shipping means you should start with almost nothing, because the job is to start delivering value for your community/customers as quickly as possible. And they don't want to wait! [head A] Build as little as possible As I said in the last chapter , constraints lead to creativity . If you’re a minimalist entrepreneur , the early stages are all about constraints. Now that you’re productizing you have to add in more limits. In addition to your product doing just one thing (at first), there are other ways to control the temptation to try to do everything at once...or to try to do it perfectly . I ask myself four questions every time I want to build something new: [Num list] 1) Can I ship it in the span of a weekend? The first iteration of most solutions can and should be prototyped in 2-3 days. 2) Is it making my customers’ life a little better? That’ s how I define a minimum viable product (MVP). 3) Is a customer willing to pay me for it? It’s important for the business to be profitable from day one, so creating something valuable enough for people to pay for is key . 63",523
Page 64,"4) Can I get feedback quickly? Make sure that you’re building a product for people who can let you know if you’re doing a good job or not. The faster you get feedback, the faster you’ll build something truly valuable and worth paying for . Note that there are no constraints around how pretty the product is or how well-written the code is. That’ s another reason to do as little as you possibly can: to be honest with yourself about how useful your product actually is. A product that is beautiful or has great marketing behind it may feel more useful than it actually is . But if your product is incredibly minimal and useful, and people look past the lack of polish and use it, you will know you are onto something. The perfect example of this is CraigsList. It’ s never been pretty , but it’ s always worked so well that it didn’t matter . And it’ s so useful that it’ s spawned a whole world of businesses created from that model. The goal here is to build something “good enough.” Good enough to show others, and good enough for them to pay for . Which is almost always much less than you think. Ryan Hoover launched Product Hunt,a site for product-loving enthusiasts to share and geek out over the latest mobile apps, websites, hardware projects, and tech creations, with an email list and Linkydink, a tool for creating collaborative daily email digests. It happened quickly . Hoover says, “Over Thanksgiving break, we designed and built Product Hunt,” he says. “Five days later , we had a very minimal but fully functional product...W e emailed our supporters a link to Product Hunt, informing them not to share it publicly . The supporters were thrilled to join and play with a working version of something they had thought about and indirectly , helped build. That day we acquired our first 30 users. By the end of the week, we had 100 users and felt ready to share Product Hunt with the world.” 52 From the very beginning, Product Hunt grew consistently , and there was enough momentum that Hoover realized it was a project worth pursuing. His day job building tools for game developers had given him time and space to experiment (see freelancing), and he had a clear idea of what he wanted Product Hunt to be - a place where people could post, communicate, and comment. He knew he didn’t need to reinvent the wheel; he could use something similar to the format of Reddit. But since he isn’t an engineer , he still found himself asking, “how am I going to build it? Who will develop it?” In the end, rather than get bogged down by those questions, he decided 52 000 to share Product Hunt with the world : Lenny Rachitsky, “How the Biggest Consumer Apps Got Their First 1,000 Users - Issue 25,” Lenny's Newsletter , May 12, 2020, https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/p/how-the-biggest-consumer-apps-got. 64",651
Page 65,"that the newsletter was a superquick, no code way to get the project of f the ground and to build some confidence around his idea. Like me, Ryan doesn’t believe that founders should start with code. “Do shitty work people love at first,” he says. As more and more infrastructure gets built by new businesses (including, perhaps, the one you’re working on now), it is getting cheaper , faster , and more accessible to build a MVP without code. What that means is that you shouldn’t wait until tomorrow to get started. The lower the barriers to entry , the more competition you will have. The trendline is simple: democratization. Everything that a software engineer can do today , everyone can do tomorrow . It means you need to know less to do more. Even if your service is manual, or your product is physical, you will be able to take advantage of software to provide your service as ef ficiently as possible. Every single business is in some way tech-enabled, even though the end product may not be. For example, if you are building a software business, you can visit Makerpad and learn how to connect Gumroad and Carrd to accept orders on your website without writing a single line of code. And when you are ready to automate your manual fulfillment process, it will teach you how to add Airtable and Google Forms and Mailchimp.There are products like Notion, which we use to run our entire company . And there are services like Zapier , which allow you to automate the connections between all the software you use. Similar to processizing your workflow as you were helping people, these tools will let you processize and later productize the internal functions of your business itself. Perhaps most importantly , they will save you money . The further you can get without hiring your first engineer if you are building a software product, the higher your chances of achieving profitability . And the further you get, the better the employee you can hire. (And more often than you think, these people will find you!) [head A] Ship early and often Building a business is a lesson in fast feedback loops and iteration. Imagine if you were on a boat searching for treasure, but you could only ping your radar once a year . Then, once a month. Then, every day . The boat is your business, and the treasure is product-market fit. You will be wrong a lot; the goal is to get less wrong as quickly as you can. This is why shipping early and often is so important. Gumroad, for example, has never shipped a “v2” in nine years. Instead, we have shipped tens of thousands (literally) of incremental and major improvements over time. Each time, we cross the threshold for some customer from “I may want this later” to “I need this now.” 65",598
Page 66,"Your goal is to move away from being paid directly for your time. This is important because your time is far more valuable than your money , and so you should almost always welcome the trade. Over time, you can improve on the exchange rate, but you should always know what it is. For example, if you are helping people for $10 an hour, you can set a goal to get to $20 an hour . You can do this by building software tools to help you do your job twice as fast, or increase demand for your service such that you are able to charge more. Ultimately , you will be able to make the equivalent of thousands of dollars per hour by starting and scaling a minimalist business, but at the beginning, you’re still learning and iterating as fast as you can. After all, what matters are not just the processes you build for your business; it’ s also the processes you build for yourself. While it may seem obvious how to productize a SaaS business, productizing isn’t just about coding and software. It applies to any minimalist business including Interintellect. Because Anna Gát processized early , Interintellect has a predictable, repeatable format based on four pillars: creating a moderated space, allowing equal speaking time for participants, promoting fun and entertainment, and establishing a patient, transparent, multidisciplinary atmosphere. The salons are organized and tracked by topic, time zone, and host, and a tight feedback loop allows the company to surface the most discussed topics in the community forum and to program events based on customer preferences. “One interesting thing you only learn in practice after doing it 1,000 times,” she says, “is what you’re really making. I was convinced I was making events at the start, but I’m really making hosts.” As a result, Gat has launched a new platform that will enable hosts to build and schedule their own events and to approve, onboard, and train new hosts based on the incredibly strong set of norms by which the community abides. As Interintellect expands, Anna expects to further automate the company’ s processes so that they can host 60 events per day around the world. For her , the goal of Interintellect salons is ultimately entertainment even as she systematizes a ritual around how people congregate so that they can learn, share, and interact in an intellectually relaxed space. Even if your business doesn’t at first seem to lend itself to processizing and productizing, Interintellect is a good example of how this methodology can be applied in almost any setting. [head A] Create conditions for liftof f At the end of Chapter 2, I talked about squashing doubts, but if you’re like 99% of the founders out there, doubts will be with you every step of the way , especially when you bring your product out to a community that you know and respect. Even though selling to strangers is inef ficient, people are still desperate to avoid the awkwardness of telling 66",634
Page 67,"their community what they’re working on. Sorry , but it’ s still absolutely critical to start there. This self-doubt never goes away . Even when you conquer community , you’ll still have self-doubt about product. When you build and ship a product, you’ll have self-doubt about sales. When you’ve done everything mentioned in this book, you’ll have self-doubt about whether you’re qualified enough to write it all down. (Hi!) After stepping down as CEO of Product Hunt in 2020, Ryan Hoover found himself thinking more about the conditions that made it possible for him to build Product Hunt and how it might be possible to help squash self-doubt for others and to create the same kind of conditions for the founders he works with through W eekend Fund, the early stage startup fund he launched in 2017. For him, it comes down to four things: validation, mentorship, time, and accountability . In the early stages, even though you’re probably laser focused on your product, you can still set yourself up for success, whether you’re going it alone or working with a co-founder , whether you’re bootstrapping or you have investors. If you’ve productized, your first customers have hopefully validated the utility of your of fering, but you’ll also sometimes want or even need someone you respect to give you the confidence to move forward and to vanquish imposter syndrome. That’ s where a trusted mentor comes in. Traditionally , a mentor is an older , wiser person who’s already done what you’re trying to do, but a mentor can be anyone who of fers suggestions and helps with aspects of your business that aren’t so easy for you. “W e tend to get wrapped up in our own heads,” Ryan says, “and sometimes all it takes is ten minutes of talking to someone else to uncover a solution.” You also want to protect the time you need to grow your idea. No matter what stage of life you’re in, there will always be demands on your time, and when your company is a side project, it may grow more slowly than you like. There will be weeks or months when other priorities jump ahead of building your product, but don’t use that as an excuse to lose forward momentum, even if it’ s invisible to everyone but you. When I first launched Gumroad, I was full-time at Pinterest, and I dedicated every other weekend to shipping at least one new feature. The other weekend I reserved for everything else. You might be able to do that on your own, but if you can’t, your community , which has supported and inspired you up until now , can also serve as a source of accountability whether through in-person “co-working” meetings, a Slack channel, a course you’re participating in, or yes, a customer you’ve made a promise to. Just like you used processization to build your product, you can also use processization to set yourself up to grow with your company . Just get going. Your failures will fade, while your successes will stick around and compound. You didn’t believe you’d get this far , yet you did. Just remind yourself of that as you keep going. 67",714
Page 68,"We began this chapter talking about momentum. Let’ s end it talking about confidence: as you build the solution you’ll sell to your first customer , you will also gain the momentum and confidence to know you’re on the right track and to take the next leap forward. If you’re lucky , you may be able to get away with building almost nothing. If you’ve solved a real pain point for real people, they won’t fault the simplicity but appreciate you for it. Some will even ask to pay . This is the exciting part: you made your first $1 on the internet. You crossed the great divide from zero to one. You started.

The fastest feedback loop will be one you have with yourself. - Before you build anything at all, see how little you can get away with charging for .

Page 69,"Chapter 4. Sell to your first 100 customers [epi] It just took off. A true viral success. – No one, ever After building a product, many people think the next step is launching it to the world. Hollywood has premiere parties, while Silicon V alley has Demo Days and Product Hunt launches and “Show HN” posts. This obsession with launches is not exclusive to Hollywood and Silicon V alley. It pervades the thinking of cities and towns throughout the world. There’ s probably a restaurant near you, with a giant red sign pinned over its entrance, reading “GRAND OPENING.” [INSER T ART17] 69",141
Page 70,"It invites you in, with a promise that you’ll be one of the first. Maybe you’ll get a deal. But tomorrow , and even a month from now , the sign is still there. They’re always opening, and grandly , too! Lots of businesses go this route. Jef frey Katzenberg, co-founder and former CEO of Dreamworks, and Meg Whitman, former CEO of eBay , founded streaming video service Quibi, a cautionary tale of launching before actually going to market. The company raised $1.8B and bought Super Bowl ads, expecting the whole world to flock to their service. It planned a launch party meant to draw 150 celebrities among its 1,500 guests that was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately , the app bombed. Only 300,000 people downloaded Quibi on day one, compared to Disney+’ s 4 million. One month post-launch, Quibi had fallen of f the Top 100 chart; and within six months, it shut down and returned its investors’ money . This experience isn’t so dif ferent for software businesses. Two excitable co-founders work on an app, submit it to Product Hunt, and see thousands of sign ups on the first day. A few months later , no one is using it, and they’re onto a new project. Rinse and repeat. But businesses are not something you engage with once, talk to your friends about, and then forget about as you move on to the next thing. Your business should have customers for life, not just for a Friday night. That’ s because the real story of starting and then growing a business isn’t really that thrilling most days. Between start and success, it can be a slog. It can take years. And it often isn’t nearly as gIamorous as you expect. But you will have many small victories, and over time they can build into a sense of satisfaction and pride that comes from persistence. In the last chapter we focused on process and product, but once you have your MVPs, it’s time to turn your attention to your first customers. If you wait too long, if you endlessly iterate without showing your work to the world, you may feel productive even though you are slowly (or quickly) running out of runway . That’ s why it’ s so important to start. Once you have enough repeat customers, you have product-market fit, which is a milestone worth celebrating and a sign you can think about launching. Until then, skip the one-time grand opening, and instead, focus on the slow and steady journey of selling to your first 100 customers. Sales is not a dirty word I interviewed a lot of people for this book, and you wouldn’t believe how hard it was to get anyone to talk about sales. No one seems to like selling. Almost everyone has horror stories about being “sold something” by a pushy used car or timeshare salesman. 70",635
Page 71,"No one likes that kind of selling. It’ s sleazy , and it depends on information asymmetry . Our way is dif ferent. You already have a relationship with the community , and you’re selling a product that adds value to the life of a customer who is happy to pay for it. Eventually strangers will buy your product, but mostly because your customers are spreading the gospel of your business and product, not because they saw an ad. But it will take time to get there. It’ s not something you hit on day one. It will take time to iron out the imperfections and create a product experience people want to tell others about. Look at your own life: when was the last time you went on Twitter or Facebook and shouted from your digital balcony about a product you loved? It just doesn’t happen that often. “Viral success” is a myth, pure and simple. There is no such thing. It’ s just something journalists say about a person, company , product, or service whose seemingly rapid rise is inexplicable from the outside. Most of us–and that includes journalists–only notice new things when they’ve reached escape velocity . We’re often unaware of the previous months or years of hard work and stumbles. At the end of this chapter , you’ll launch, but it’ s because you’ll be celebrating milestones that will actually mean something about the longevity and sustainability of your business. You will be profitable, you will have customers paying for your product, and they will be telling other customers about it. Then, you can launch–or rather you can celebrate by saying thank you to the community and the customers who have helped you build from nothing to something. Until then, treat the sales process as an opportunity for discovery . You think your product is market-ready . It’s probably not. You think you’ve figured out the correct pricing tiers. You probably haven’t. Turn every failed conversion into an insight. Either you’re talking to the wrong person and you need to shift your focus to a new one, or they’re the right person but your product still has work to do to solve their problem. Both are good learnings, learnings you want to have before you start marketing to a broader audience. For now , sales is an education process. Your customers will get to know you, and you’ll get to know what’ s working, what’ s not, and how to fix it. Selling might not always go smoothly at the beginning, but I guarantee waiting won’t make it any easier . Once you’ve figured out how to get started, the next challenge is pricing. [head A] Charge something Pricing is hard. In the early days, you may be tempted to give your product away for free or to charge less than the value of your time or the raw materials you used to make it. 71",617
Page 72,"Don’t. In order to stay alive, you need to make money . The only way to do that is not only to charge something, but to charge something that allows you to stay afloat. If you’ve productized, then you’ve already figured out an initial pricing structure for your first customers even if you know it’ s temporary . After all, pricing, just like every other part of a minimalist business, is subject to iteration. Eventually , the type of customer you have will influence how and why you charge, but at the beginning, as you build your solution, keep in mind that you’re able to charge in two ways: [bullet; PE: please preserve bold] - Cost-based (things that have inherent costs, for example web servers or an employee’ s time) - If you need to pay a certain amount, you can add a “margin,” say 20%, and charge that. For example, retail stores often buy wholesale and double the price when they sell it to consumers (giving them a margin of 50%). Marketplaces such as iT unes or iStockPhoto often go with this method. - Value-based (a feature with clear value) - This is charging for something not because it costs you money to deliver , but because it has inherent value for the customer . For example, Netflix may have a multi-screen feature that doesn’t cost them any money to provide (beyond the engineering costs to ship the feature in the first place), but they are able to charge a monthly fee for it. The goal is to eventually charge people for tiered levels of service, which you can do when your product, service, or software has an established value and brand. Think of the tiers as you would think of them for a plane ticket - you’ll get to your destination whether you sit in economy , business class, or first class but with a substantially different level of service. Tiered pricing is a common practice for most software businesses, and it changes all the time depending on the features of fered. For example, Circle, a community platform for creators, has three levels of service: basic, professional, and enterprise, based both on the number of members in the community and on available features and integration. Even if you start low and go up over time, it is important to charge something. There is a very large dif ference between free and $1--that’ s the zero price effect . As behavioral economist Dan Ariely writes in Predictably Irrational , “people will jump for something free even when it’ s something they don’t want.” He uses the example of a long line of college students waiting for free, terribly unhealthy , brownies. Asked to pay even just 1 cent, and the line of kids disappears. 53 [INSER T ART18] 53 000 the line of kids disappears : Dan Ariely, Predictably Irrational (New York: Harper Collins, 2008), Kindle. 72",626
Page 73,"Advertising-driven media models are another example.– When the reader doesn’t pay anything, it’ s often hard to convince them that it's valuable when the time comes to start charging for it. Pricing decisions are not permanent. A price is just a part of a product, like everything else, and it can and will change over time. Similar to product development, your goal is to start the discovery process, not get to the perfect end result right away . It’s worth noting that when prices for products do change, they generally go up. This should be true for you as well: as your product improves and you are able to of fer a better service, your of fering will become more valuable to your customer as well–and you may even introduce higher tiers for your superusers. Once you’ve picked a price, you need to shop it around. I recommend starting with those closest to you: your friends and family . [head A] 73",204
Page 74,"Friends and family first In Silicon V alley, there’ s a term for the first round of funding: the friends and family round. This may be even more common outside of the Bay Area, where venture capitalists and angel investors do not patrol the streets looking for things to fund. But friends and family aren’t just important when it comes to funding. Whether or not they’ve given you a dime up until now , it’s worth pitching them to be your first customers. This may make you uncomfortable even if you know that friends and family are in the dead center of your community . It certainly made me uncomfortable, shoving my business in my friends’ faces, and asking them to try Gumroad when I knew I didn’t have all the kinks worked out yet . But when you’re just getting started, with few credentials to your name, who trusts you more than your friends and family? And if they don’t, who will? Yet, people believe they can skip their friends and family in favor of launching on Kickstarter and going viral. But even Kickstarter knows this isn’t the case. “Millions of people visit Kickstarter every week, but support always begins with people you know ,” it reads on their website. “Friends, fans, and the communities you’re a part of will likely be some of your earliest supporters, not to mention your biggest resources for spreading the word about your project.” 54 Projects do go viral occasionally , I’m sure, but virtually none without a big initial push from the friends, family , and fans of the project’ s creators. All of that is to say it’ s normal and maybe even expected to rely on friends and family to provide initial support, and to be the first to buy your product. Remember , you’ve built something you think provides real value. It’ s worth paying for even if it’ s not perfect! PleaseNotes founder and CEO Cheryl Sutherland was using journaling and af firmations to uncover her next professional step when she came up with the idea for her company , which of fers coaching programs and makes journals and other products geared toward personal development. A close friend who was a graphic designer helped design her 55 website and her first product, the Pleasenotes, a set of three sticky notepads printed with af firmations, and two other friends who had a crowdfunding consulting business advised her on how to launch an ef fective Kickstarter campaign to generate preorders for her second product, a PleaseNotes journal.

It takes time for a movie to figure out its pacing, hence test screenings. That part will be no dif ferent for the business you want to build, too.

Page 76,"This is the same way your business grows: starting with the people who care about you the most, and “ending” with the people who care about you the least. Even if you’ve successfully solved a problem for your community , it may take some time and some patience to get their attention. Humans, like objects, have inertia. Everyone is on a path, and it usually takes a bump to knock them in a dif ferent direction, even if it is a better one in the form of the solution you’re of fering with your business. Beyond the other human beings you personally know or are connected to, you can seek out similar customers in the physical environment around you. Every neighborhood, street, and downtown is a community , where people live together , congregate, and hang out. In thriving communities, there are local businesses, event venues, and block parties.

Your product isn’t the only thing that can help people, you can. Don’t think of it as finding customers. Think of it as helping people and creating fans. In the next chapter , we’ll talk about formal marketing, but long before you ever implement a more structured plan you can still take advantage of opportunities for strategic outreach. Every community has reporters and micro-influencers, who report on the goings on within the community . In Portland, where I live, there are dozens of Instagram and Twitter accounts about every facet of the city . These are student, amateur , and professional journalists. They live to cover what you are up to. This is how you make that happen. [num list; PE: please preserve bold] 1.

With Gumroad, I did this literally hundreds of times. And thousands of creators later , if I see a creator I really like who I think Gumroad could help, I still reach out. 3. Ask for their personal, candid feedback. Do not ask for reviews, or a social media post, or for them to tell their friends. Your goal is to improve your product experience, and you should make it clear that you massively appreciate their support. When you first bring your product to market, you may be part of one community , but that community will grow and change as your business grows and changes. It’ s simply discovering additional points of overlap and need and letting a broader group know that you have come up with a new solution to their problem. And hopefully , your customers will develop into their own community of fans over time. This is about building relationships. You will be doing business for a long time, and it is much easier to keep a customer than to find a new one. Never oversell. Be honest, open, and always kind. Show them how you most recently improved your product. Tell them a recent failing. Don’t sell them on your product, educate them on your journey and learnings. [head a] 77",529
Page 78,"Cold emails, calls, and messages Long before you get to the bottom of the list of people you already know or could know , you’re going to be sending a lot of emails, you’re going to be making a lot of calls, and you’re going to be knocking on a lot of doors. It’ s your job to reach out to friends, family , and members of your community who you may not have seen for a while. Your calls are a chance to tell them what you’re up to and ask them if they’re interested in becoming customers. Some will say yes, but many will say no. Once you’re okay with the nos, you’re ready to sell to strangers. In the early days (read: years) of Gumroad, we scoured the web for people who could benefit from a product like Gumroad and then told them about it. Literally thousands of times. That's the only way , really , when you're young and no one cares or knows who you are, to get folks to use your product. Over time, you can get away with doing it less and less. But until you have a lot of customers or some other force that can supply ongoing momentum, there's nothing better than knocking on doors. This is a tried and true technique, used by political canvassers, the LDS Church, and others… because it works! Trust me, if there was a better way , people would have stopped. Even Katrina Lake, CEO of Stitchfix and one of Forbes’ s Richest Self-Made W omen in 2020 , started out with cold calls and cold messages on LinkedIn to potential investors. 58 “The more shameless you can be, the thicker skin you have, the better ,” she says. 59 “People are going to not write back and people are going to say no, but every now and then someone’ s gonna be interested and say yes. And you wouldn’t have had that chance if you hadn’t gotten all the no’ s first.” While you may not be hitting up investors, 60 you will be talking to people over and over again who will say no. The sooner you get used to it, the sooner you stop taking it personally and use those nos as a learning opportunity , the better . I get it. It’ s awkward and uncomfortable to reach out to people you don’t necessarily know personally , many of whom will ignore or reject you. My sense is that people who wish to reach customers some other way , like SEO or content marketing, are looking for an out. If that's you: stop! It doesn't exist!

You may find that talking about your process and your product and the path you’ve taken to get there is far less dif ficult than you think. After all, this is your work, and if you’re bringing it out to the world, you should be excited and proud, so don’t skip this chance at discovery . A stellar launch doesn’t change this. Fanfare doesn’t bring real customers, as Quibi learned. Consistent growth comes after a long period of time, mostly driven, especially at the beginning, by a hard-working sales team – starting with you. If you need help getting started, here’ s an example: [extract] Hi John, I saw you’re selling a PDF on your website using PayPal, and manually emailing everyone who buys the PDF . I built a service called Gumroad which basically automates all of this.

Best, Sahil, founder and CEO of Gumroad. [end extract] Don’t copy/paste. Each email will refine your ability to write better emails. Done right, you’re not only educating customers, but learning from them about what you can do better . It’s a learn-learn situation. Manual ""sales"" will be 99% of your growth in the early days, and word of mouth will be 99% of your growth in the latter days. It's not a glamorous answer , but it's true. Things like paid marketing, SEO, and content marketing can come later , once you have a hundred customers, once you’re profitable, and once your customers are referring more customers to you. Only then! The best news of all is that once you have 100 customers, you can use the same playbook to get to 1,000. Once you have 1,000, you can use a similar playbook to get to 10,000. When Slack IPOed in 2020 at a valuation of $16 billion, its of fering documents showed that 575 of their customers accounted for approximately 40% of their revenue. This just goes to show that you need far fewer customers than you may think. And when you get there you can finally say to yourself, “Congratulations: You’ve successfully pushed the 79",540

You can ask your customers for help, improve your product, and keep going.” Big network-focused tech companies boast dazzling metrics, but their actual profits—when they have profits, anyway—come from a very tiny portion of their total audience. The rest of us might do better to ignore the lurkers and freeloaders altogether and focus on core paying customers. Depending on the nature of the product or service, anywhere from a few dozen to a few thousand regular customers will be more than enough to keep a business viable long-term. Mailchimp is a good example of how focusing on smaller , reliable customers makes more sense than swinging for the fences. Ben Chestnut and Dan Kurzius first started a web design agency called the Rocket Science Group with a focus on big, corporate clients, but at the same time, they also built Mailchimp, an email marketing service for small businesses. For about seven years, they ran both businesses until they closed the web design agency in 2007. They found that working for small businesses gave them more freedom and allowed them to be more creative.” 61 Chestnut and Kurzius have a universe of of ferings, but Mailchimp’ s service is free up to the first 2,000 emails. Once customers want to send to a larger list or need extra services, their plans begin at ten dollars per month and go up from there (see earlier conversation on tiered pricing!). Even though Mailchimp could broaden its reach to corporations or institutions, the company’ s customer base is still small businesses, and they’ve not strayed from their mission to build out features for their core community . 62 It may be surprising, but it is not a coincidence. Whether you’re just starting or you’ve been in business for years, your most important clients are your community . They trust you because you’ve helped them grow their own businesses. It’s not happenstance that they’re ready to support you when you have your own. This isn’t just about huge SaaS businesses either . It also applies to smaller businesses too. Across the spectrum of minimalist entrepreneurs, I see a common pattern: manual sales, finding your community , talking about your journey , highlighting your customers, and getting authentic coverage. If you started from community , and you continue to pay attention and to solve the persistent problems your community has, then those first customers can take you very far . Growth-at-all-costs is all about selling to strangers so that you can scale, but profitability-at-all-costs means you don’t need to depend on strangers to keep your business afloat.

The math looks different for everybody , but the goal is the same: financial independence. When I did it for myself, I needed about $2,000 a month to maintain my lifestyle. If your product costs $10 a month, like Gumroad, you need 200 customers. That doesn’t seem so bad.

While there were hundreds of recipes for soaps and lotions available, there were few , if any , recipes for deodorant even though many people were concerned about ingredients in traditional formulations. Jaime had tried all of the natural deodorants but had found that none of them worked for her, so she decided to make one herself. She experimented for months until she found 63 an ef fective formulation and landed on a scent, cedarwood, that she loved. Six months after the shampoo class, she had a product line of lotions and deodorant, and she was ready to sell to her first customers. 64 Since you already know that Jaime sold her company to Unilever , I bet you’re thinking that her business took of f immediately , but I’ll remind you that overnight success is a myth. It’ s not going to happen for you, and it didn’t happen for Jaime either . She set up a simple website and a Facebook page for her business where she posted articles, recipes, and information. In the first months, she sold her products on consignment at 65 65 000 articles, recipes, and information : Schmidt, Supermaker, 38. 64 000 to sell to her first customers : Schmidt, Supermaker , 38. 63 000 she decided to make one herself : Jaime Schmidt, Supermaker: Crafting Business on Your Own Terms (San Francisco: Chronicle Prism, 2020), 24. 82",377

People stopped at her booth to try the deodorant and lotions, and she found a rhythm to her conversations with prospective customers, asking them about the products they used; talking about her products and how she had tested them; and convincing people that her natural deodorant actually worked. 66 The following year , she decided to go all-in on her idea. She took two part-time positions with stores that sold Schmidt’ s, a decision that served a dual purpose. First, interacting with the clientele gave her a chance to gather customer insights about her own products and to learn about the inner workings of retail. But just as importantly , the income from those gigs served as the seed money to get Schmidt’ s off the ground. The in-store customers as well as the people she continued to meet at festivals and fairs were most enthusiastic about the deodorant she made; many times, they returned to tell her how well it worked and to buy more. She says, “early customer feedback allowed me to 67 perfect my formula, determine future scents, and recognize where I was making the most impact.” And once she had refined her deodorant, “customers gave me validation that my product worked astonishingly well, and they spread the word.” 68 Jaime’ s business was growing, but by the end of 201 1, she asked herself, “what would it take to get to the next level?” Armed with customer insights, she knew the answer . “I had a lightbulb moment where I understood I could accomplish far more by focusing on just one product and doing it right.” Deodorant was her bestseller and was the clear choice for moving forward. She recognized a white space and saw an opportunity to position natural products as more than just a niche offering. Jaime Schmidt started 2012 with new , modern packaging for the deodorant, which was designed to set it apart from the competition. She looked beyond the direct-to-consumer sales channels and the natural and wellness retailers that her competitors used almost exclusively , and in 2015, she expanded into traditional grocery stores and pharmacies, which allowed her to reach more customers and to enable greater access to healthy natural products. Her creativity , innovation, and hard work paid of f. Schmidt earned appearances on Fox News and the Today Show; mentions on social media from celebrities and influencers; articles in national publications, and distribution on the shelves of Target and W almart. Though it was bittersweet, Jaime realized that a larger company with more resources could bring her vision and mission to an even wider customer base, and she signed the deal with Unilever right before Christmas 2017. Reflecting on her journey , she says, “When I’m asked about what made Schmidt’ s so successful, I often say that my customers were my business plan. It started when I listened to those at the farmers market, and it continued through each step of growth. 68 000 they spread the word : Schmidt, Supermaker, 57. 67 000 to buy more : Schmidt, Supermaker, 53. 66 000 her natural deodorant actually worked : Schmidt, Supermaker , 41-3. 83",681
Page 84,"Staying hyper tuned in to my customers always guided and served me.” Not sales. Not marketing. Customers, educating, and being educated. Launch to celebrate A launch is a stepping stone. A thing that happens when your business already has customers, is doing well, and is going to last. Many companies go out of business within the first year . Why make a big deal out of a business before you’re sure it’ll stick around? Instead, build a successful business and “launch” as a celebration of your success. Spend your business’ s profits on it, not your own money . Better yet, celebrate your customers’ success. I think celebrating a milestone is a great excuse to launch. What about having successfully sold 100 customers? Once you’re running a growing profitable business with a hundred customers who love you and who you care about, you can celebrate them–by launching. Throw a party . Invite all of your customers and thank them for their ongoing support. Do that, and you’ll have customers lining up at your door. They’ll be people you already know , and who know you. Some of them will bring their own friends and families and maybe even members of their own communities too. They may even help promote your event before it happens, because you’ve told them about it and they’re excited about supporting you. Plus, they can actually speak to how great your product is, and how much better you’ve made their life. Your customers may be even better salespeople than you are. Good–there’ s more of them than there are of you! Once you have a hundred customers, some of them now repeat customers, selling your product better than you can, you’ll know you’re ready to move onto the next chapter of your business: marketing.

Page 87,"Chapter 5. Market by being you [epi] Marketing is really just about sharing your passion. — Michael Hyatt 69 Congratulations! You have community , a product, and a hundred customers. That means you’ve arrived at “product-market fit,” a term coined by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen for being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market. I 70 define it more specifically for minimalist businesses this way: repeat customers. Repeat customers mean that your business is able to persist without ongoing sales ef forts, so you can start to focus on scaling. First, your customer acquisition and sales strategy , then your company , then your ambition. So where does marketing fit in? Marketing is sales at scale. Remember that before we built a minimum viable product, we had a manual valuable process. And before you can have marketing, you need to sell to your first 100 customers; that’ s because sales is the process upon which you build marketing. While sales is outbound and one-by-one, marketing is inbound and about attracting hundreds of potential customers at a time. Sales got you to one hundred customers. Marketing will get you thousands. But do not confuse marketing with advertising. Ads cost money , and minimalist entrepreneurs only spend money when we absolutely have to. W e do cover ads later in this chapter because it is a part of marketing, but in true minimalist fashion, we’ll start with the free stuf f. Because it’ s only once you’ve learned enough from sales–like you did with your manual process for your product–that you’re ready to spend money on marketing. Last. It’s better to start by spending time instead of money . Blog posts are free. Twitter , Instagram, YouTube, and Clubhouse are free, too. Instead of spending money , let’s start there, by building an audience. 70 000 a product that can satisfy that market : Marc Andreessen, “The Pmarca Guide to Startups,” Pmarchive, June 25, 2007, https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html. 69 000 “sharing your passion” : Peter Economy, “11 Michael Hyatt Quotes to Inspire You to Happiness and Success.” Inc., February 11, 2016, https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/11-michael-hyatt-quotes-to-inspire-you-to-happiness-and-success.ht ml#:~:text=%22Marketing%20is%20really%20just%20about,others%20something%20you%20care%20a bout. 87",573
Page 88,"[head A] The power of an audience You started your business by tapping into a pre-existing community , and now it’ s time to move onto building an audience. What’ s the dif ference? While your community is a part of your audience, your audience is not a part of your community . Instead, an audience is a network of everyone that you can reach when you have something to say . That may include your followers on each social media platform, your business’ s followers, your email newsletter subscribers, the people who walk by your retail store window every day , and more. If you needed to tell as many people as possible that the world was ending in an hour , how many people would you be able to tell? That’ s your audience. Selling allows you to test the waters with these new people because it forces you to leave your bubble and convince them one-by-one, improving your product along the way. Marketing is harder , because instead of going to your customers, you have to make them leave their bubbles and come to you. People have lives, and things to do, and using your product today is unlikely to make an appearance on their priority lists. But if you can figure out how to bring customers to you, you’ll have a much easier time scaling your business on all fronts. Hiring becomes easier , sales becomes easier , growth becomes easier . Everything about building a business becomes easier when you have a group of people that grows larger by the day rooting for your success. In the last chapter , I talked about selling to your first customers aka your friends, family , and community , and in this chapter , we’ll talk about what to do when you’ve reached out to everyone you already know . I’m not a big fan of selling to strangers, but I am a big fan of bringing strangers into your audience and eventually turning them into customers. People do not go from being strangers to being customers in one step. They go from being strangers to being vaguely aware of your existence to slowly over time becoming fans and finally to being customers and then repeat customers who help you spread the word. Start with making fans. [head A] Make fans, not headlines Think about a company you like. Can you name the founders? Can you imagine what their of fice looks like? Can you hear their voices in your head? I’d bet that for many companies, the answer is yes. 88",508
Page 89,"Why are you able to do this? Because you’ve read articles about them and follow them on social media. You are much more likely to buy their products, if you haven’t already . Unfortunately , most founders are not comfortable putting themselves at the center of their company’ s story . But you need to. People don’t care about companies, they care about other people. And you’ve built something from nothing. You love what you do. You don’t need to share what you ate for lunch, but you should take your hard-earned learnings and share them with the world. I’ve seen that no matter how successful they are, many founders still suf fer from imposter syndrome. There’ s so much you don’t know , and so many people more knowledgeable than you. There are bigger businesses than yours with more revenue, more employees, and more accolades. That will always be true, and it doesn’t matter . You have something to of fer. And your existing customers care. They are paying you for your work, they’re interested in how you think, and they want to know why you made certain decisions and how your product came to be. As you grow and iterate, your product will improve. You will garner more credibility and trust. And you will have learned so much that could benefit others. When you were engaging with your community and selling to your first 100 customers you were already doing this. You were personally connecting with people, telling them your story , and listening to theirs. Building an audience, the first step towards making fans, is having these conversations at scale. [head a] The minimalist marketing funnel [INSER T ART22] 89",363
Page 90,"The journey of each customer will be dif ferent, but it always starts with someone having no idea who you are or what you’re selling. Eventually , they will encounter your product somewhere in their Instagram feed or in a forum post or in a tweet a friend shares. They 90",63
Page 91,"will almost definitely forget about it. One day , even though they’ll forget who posted it, they may “like” it. They may engage a few times. Eventually , they will get interested–not in your product, but in what you or your business has to say . They’ll hit that big “follow” button. Maybe they’ll click through to your website and check it out. If they like what you think and if they like what you say and how you say it, they may like what you’ve built. Most people will not be a fit for your business. That’ s okay. Your audience will grow much larger than your customer base–but your customer base is a subset, likely the most passionate, of your audience. If they are a fit, they’ll start to consider your product. Then signal their intent by signing up for an account, let’ s say , and then evaluating your functionality , pricing, and more. Hopefully , they’ll eventually purchase. While you may be tempted to cut as many steps out of this funnel as possible, you may also want to add steps to this funnel, like a free trial for instance. But you can’t shorten this process, no matter how much you’d like to. Every customer will engage, follow , research, consider , and finally buy (and hopefully buy again!). At every stage, you must listen to your customers and iterate accordingly even if they surprise you. There is no right or wrong approach. There’ s just the right or wrong approach for your customers, your business, and your willingness to put in the time, energy , and analysis to figure it out. [head A] Top of the funnel: Social media and SEO There are seven billion strangers out there. Which ones do you target? Start with the communities that your existing customers belong to, other than yours, and move outward from there. Marketing is second degree sales, so your existing customers should already be spreading the word about your product. Ideally they’re doing it because it makes their experience better . Your customers may go on first dates at your ice cream store, for example. You can also incentivize this behavior . If you’re an ice cream store, you may of fer a free waffle cone to anyone who posts a story to their Instagram. The analog world has the concept of “foot traf fic.” Real estate agents will tell you again and again: “location, location, location.” Location matters, because people are going about their days in the physical world, and if you happen to be where they are, literally , you may make a new sale you wouldn’t have made otherwise. 91",574
Page 92,"Social media is not so dif ferent. Instead of Main St, there’ s the Instagram “Explore” tab. Instead of Martin Luther King Boulevard, it’ s the Twitter algorithm throwing new things you may appreciate (or be outraged by) into your feed. These algorithms work by judging the theoretical “quality” of your content. The secret sauce is unique to each platform, but it is typically judged by what is going to lead to continued engagement by the end-user . Generally , this means that your content should lead to likes, shares, comments, and other forms of positive af firmation on the part of the consumer on the other side of the screen. Location does still matter for digital products, just not in the same way that it does for the ice cream store. Just like you may choose a dif ferent mall for your storefront based on your kind of customer , your audience will live in dif ferent places. Twitter , to use one example, was a great place to start for Gumroad, because of the “retweet” functionality . It allowed our creators to share our tweets with their audiences. I’ve seen folks go from a few hundred followers to thousands because a single popular account retweeted their idea. And because it’ s often much easier to tweet than to produce the images, video, or audio necessary to post on other social networks, you can train yourself via a very quick feedback loop. But it depends. Instagram may be the perfect platform for your business. Or YouTube, or Reddit, or Pinterest, or several others. Try them all. The good news is it’ s much cheaper and easier to try a new platform than to move your store to a new zip code. As you find things that work, turn them into longer-form blog posts. Later , we’ll talk about how to use an email list to make sure your most devout fans hear about it, but SEO (search engine optimization) allows your content to surface to those who may not know you or your business even though they are interested in the problem you are solving. [head A] The Minimalist Entrepreneur ’s Guide to Social Media [bullet; PE: preserve bold] ● Create an account. One is your personal account (you, the human) and one is your business account (you, the business). My accounts are my own (@shl) and Gumroad’ s (@gumroad). My personal account’ s goal is to encourage more people to start businesses. If you’re reading this book, that’ s probably not surprising to you. Gumroad’ s goal is to inspire people to become creators, on Gumroad or otherwise. There’ s a subtle difference–creators and business owners are separate identities, but the 92",587
Page 93,"fundamental questions are the same: Who is your audience, what do they want out of their life, and how can you help them achieve their goals? Too many people think their business account is enough. No, it’ s not. People don’t care about your business and its success, they care about you and your struggle . ● Don’t share what you ate for lunch. Status updates about your life and your business are fine, but they won’t grow your audience. The days of discussing meals on social media are over , even on your personal account. Your goal now is to expand your reach and to provide the most value to strangers who find you on the internet. At the beginning, that might mean sharing links or retweeting other people's content, but it’ s generally best to avoid that as you keep going. People will typically follow you for your content, not others’. ● Be authentic . Social media is about ideas, not people. Be yourself, but focus on communicating a set of core ideas. What did you learn? What conversation did you have? Your job here is to give , not ask . Remember: this is not about selling . Your business account should be similar to your personal one, because they’re both you , and both should be about ideas so that you’re constantly giving value out for free. It may feel weird that you’re not talking about a new customer case study or a new feature you’ve launched. You can do that too, occasionally . But the truth is: your audience doesn’t care. They want to lose weight, laugh, be entertained, get smarter , spend time with loved ones, go home on time, sleep adequately , eat good food, be happy . Help them do that. ● Build in public. In Chapter Two, I talked about community and sharing what you were learning in the process of becoming part of a like minded group of people who share the same interests. Now it’ s time to take that a bit further on behalf of your business. Not only should you share what you learn to maintain your ties to your community , but you should also be building your business in public and sharing that process with your customers. You don’t have to be a genius or pretend to be a genius, you just need to be a step ahead of your audience in at least one thing. You just have to pay attention to and share the elements of your product that you’re working on and that you’ve improved. Even better , as you go, reach out to the folks you helped along the way and that have helped you. Ask them if your product solves the problem for them and ask them what else you can build to help make it even better . 93",576
Page 94,"● Trust the feedback loop. Start sharing, and you will soon find out what works and what does not. The brilliance of social media is the instant response (or lack of response) you get from your followers. As your audience grows, you will collect more data so that every day , you can look back at what worked, what didn’t work, and examine why . “Working” means something different for every business, but eventually your ef forts should be quantifiable, objective, and should contribute in some way to your bottom line. After all, as Brian Halligan, CEO of Hubspot says, “Feedback is the breakfast of champions.” 71 Just like your product is only as good as the experiences it enables people to have, the stuff you share on social media is too. This goes for Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Reddit, Pinterest, and every other platform that connects like-minded people to each other . There are subtle dif ferences, but you’ll figure them out quickly as you go. Soon, you’ll be able to predict how something will land before you even say it. But since I’ve already gone through that, I’m here to help you out. I’ve learned that there are three levels to the type of content people share, each one with more potential reach than the last.

Page 95,"It may be tempting to skip straight to the most “ef fective” type of content, but just like working out, you should walk before you run a 5K before you run a marathon. Your body needs time to adapt, as does your mind. And most importantly , your audience does too. Make your mistakes when few people are watching. The corollary of succeeding in public is failing in public, so you want the confidence and security of success at smaller scales before you move up the ladder . [head b] Level one: Educate Few make the transition from being themselves to being teachers, but those who do build audiences quickly , because people spend much of their time on social media in search of a better way to live, learn, and make money . This is how you start growing your audience beyond the people who already know you. You do it by providing value for free, asking for nothing in return, repeatedly . It’s a natural continuation of what you were doing in your community , only now you’re doing it with a wider group of people. If 95",227
Page 96,"you have a hundred customers, there are at least a hundred things you have learned from acquiring a hundred customers. Start by sharing those. Your existing audience will engage with these ideas, broadcasting the very best ones to their own audiences, and yours will grow as a result. You will do this every day , because it’s part of your job and because you’re already online all day anyway . Of course, this is not all you’re doing. You’re still building a company . Building a social media presence is a lagging indicator of the success of your company , and it should always be secondary to it. In 2008, Jenny and Ron Doan lost most of their savings in the financial crisis. Their kids, Al and Sarah, came up with a plan to help get their parents back on their feet. They bought a computerized quilting machine to set up their mom, an avid quilter , in a small space in their hometown of Hamilton, Missouri. Al and Sarah hoped that given the demand and the long lead time for machine quilting, Jenny could take in other people’ s projects and finish them. If she could earn $10,000 per month, they figured, she could not only make a living, but she could also rebuild the family’ s savings. Business was so bad that their idea seemed dead on arrival. Al, who had already built several internet businesses, started looking around for a way to let people know about his mom even though he had no idea where quilters hung out on the web. What he discovered was that the internet had not yet touched quilting, and that most quilters closely guarded their techniques and designs in a way that kept people, especially beginners, out rather than inviting them in to learn, to sew , and to create. Al persuaded Jenny to make ten YouTube tutorials in which she taught quilting techniques, and well, the rest is history . Jenny’ s more than 500 videos have been viewed millions of times, and, in 2020, Missouri Star Quilt Company shipped more one million orders. Hamilton has become “the Disneyland of Quilting,” and the once decaying small town hosts more than 100,000 people every year who come to visit Missouri Star ’s 16 quilt shops, restaurants, and retreat center . All of that grew from ten YouTube videos. If you’re thinking, “I don’t know where to start” or “500 videos!?!,” remind yourself that you’ve been practicing these skills for a while now . Remember how you participated in your community by commenting, contributing, and creating? You’re basically doing that here at scale. It doesn’t have to be polished, it doesn’t have to be produced, it doesn’t have to be perfect. The most important thing is to set aside a dedicated amount of time every day and to begin. [head B] 96",618
Page 97,"Level two: Inspire Education is a great way to get started, but to grow outside of your “students,” you need to grow past teaching. There are only so many people who are interested in learning physics, but Richard Feynman is much more well known than any physics teacher would be, because he talked about something grander than that. He was taking his insights from physics, and turning them into insights about life. Technically it would fall into the category of philosophy . At some point, he started motivating people, inspiring people to live better lives. As physics became a subset of what he was teaching, his physics students became a tiny subset of his new audience. And far more people want to live better lives than want to learn physics. How can you motivate and inspire? You can apply your learnings from painting, writing, designing, software engineering, or physics–to life and share them with a wider audience. You can document your projects and your progress; where you started and where you are at today . If you’re in the supplements business for example, a weight loss journey will gain more traction than an information video. Or any journey about which you can be vulnerable and authentic in public. Gimlet Media, a narrative podcasting company acquired by Spotify in 2019, launched its first podcast, StartUp , about its own humble beginnings. In the first season, founders Alex Blumberg and Matt Lieber tell the story of building their business, including one infamous episode in which Alex awkwardly and disastrously pitches venture investor Chris Sacca who then shows him what his pitch should have been. Founder fights. Check. Burnout. Check. Family drama. Check. StartUp pulls back the curtain on moments that every founder faces but few like to discuss. The result? After millions of downloads, StartUp has inspired countless entrepreneurs with its brutally honest and sometimes hilarious portrayal of what starting a business is really like. 72 Did the founders set out to inspire? Not necessarily . But by sharing their struggles and their successes, they showed others what was possible and built fans, not just customers. You can do the same. Don’t just teach. Speak from experience, tell the truth, and the inspiration will happen.

Page 98,"Level three: Entertain This third level is the most important, because it makes you relevant to a vastly larger group of potential customers–almost everyone. But it is also the hardest to achieve. Teaching is hard, motivating is hard, entertaining is hard. Now , try doing them all at the same time. Why? Think about how you spend your time. Do you spend it watching movies and TV shows and stand up comedy specials or–let’ s be honest–reading books like this one? And even if you do read books like this, how often do you talk to your friends and family about them? It’ s more likely that you spend time discussing the last basketball game you watched, or the last political scandal, or the upcoming Hollywood blockbuster . When push comes to shove, entertainment wins. Social media is no dif ferent. Every platform has a feed that puts all of the content head-to-head. There’ s one feed, for everything. Content is king, yes, but entertainment is the king of content. You don’t have to do something completely dif ferent. Keep educating people, and inspiring people, but have more fun doing it. You are still trying to teach people, but you want to do so in a way that sticks with them–and that happens when you make it entertaining. Think about the three parts of a joke: 1) say something, 2) establish a pattern, and 3) break the pattern with a punchline. Here’ s one example that worked well for me. I often talk about entrepreneurship (big surprise!) but this tweet resonated and went viral...because it’s funny: [extract] Entrepreneurship: work 60 hours a week so you don’t have to work 40 hours a week. [end extract] You will fail at this, as I certainly have. Telling jokes is hard. And because it’ s the most subjective of the three, it will be harder to figure out why some things worked while others didn’t. But that’ s exactly what building a brand is. The murky , “soft” stuf f that isn’t directly about the value you are creating for your customer . Think about your favorite brands, and how they communicate. Nike isn’t selling shoes, and Apple isn’t selling computers. They go straight for the heart, or the funny bone, and you should too. 98",510
Page 99,"But never forget: while social media is sexy–and often leads to having millions of followers, it is not the end all and be all of your business. I’ve seen creators with tens of millions of followers fumble, and creators with just a few dozen earn a living multiple times over . That’ s because social media is the top of the funnel. It’s mostly strangers, remember . Most of them are not fans yet, and almost none of them are customers. You still need to convert them, and to do that, you need to get them to commit. [head A] Middle of the funnel: Emails and communities Don’t call it a comeback. Email’ s been here since the very beginning of the internet. And it’ll probably be there until its end. Twitter , YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook can take away your business at any time, by tweaking the algorithms, shutting down your account, or making you pay to show up in people’ s feeds. So even though social media can be incredibly ef fective for gaining distribution, you are building on rented land. That’ s why , as soon as you have social media followers, you should start building an email list. Email is “peer-to-peer .” It gives you a direct line to your customers that isn’t controlled by a private company , an algorithm, or whether you spend money on advertising. And if you have someone’ s email address, it means they consider you a friend, not a stranger . [INSER T ART24] 99",331
Page 100,"Of course, you don’t spam your friends, so you shouldn’t spam these people either . Apply the same three-level framework to emails as you do to any other type of content. First, educate. Second, motivate. Third, entertain. Ideally , you’ll do all three. Just like you built a process before you built a product, the earliest version of your email list may just be a spreadsheet that you update daily or weekly with the email addresses of your friends and family , your earliest customers, and the people in your community who have shown interest in your product. You can continue this way for a while as you build your first 100 customers. Eventually you will want to automate parts of this process as your list grows and you have better uses of your time, like growing the list itself through sales, social media, and content. To do that, you can use an email marketing service like Mailchimp or ConvertKit to collect emails from your most devout fans. To sweeten the deal, give them something in exchange for their email, like a mini ebook, a short PDF guide, a video, a series of emails that help them solve a problem, or a checklist to complete. While you probably won’t have millions of subscribers, each subscriber is worth far more than a follower . 100",274
Page 101,"Besides the product itself, Gumroad’ s email list is probably our most valuable business asset. More than 140,000 creators subscribe to the Gumroad newsletter . When we have something important to say–such as a new feature that will make our creators more money–we can tell all of them about it, without anyone else’s permission. (While we’re here, subscribe to it: gumroad.com/gumroad/follow .) Over the years, they’ve heard from us dozens of times, and they will continue to, until unsubscribe do us part. You can encourage people to subscribe to your list in other ways too. In the previous section, we went in-depth on how to use social media. The next time you have a viral tweet, drop in a tweet with a link to sign up to your newsletter . Or when you have something longer to say , write a blog post. At the bottom, let people know they can subscribe for further content. Go read your favorite blogger , and I bet you’ll notice a form at the very end, with a free goodie on of fer, often called a “lead magnet.” Finally , when you make a sale, virtually every service will allow you to ask for and collect your customer ’s email addresses, along with any other information you may want to ask for (e.g. your customer ’s first name, or the city they live in). Too many creators–trained by Amazon, perhaps, which doesn’t give you any data on your customer–think of a sale like the end of a transaction, instead of the beginning of a relationship. The way we’re marketing lets you build an audience of people who are hearing from you over and over again, before and after they’ve bought your product. They are building af finity, and brand af finity is the most valuable kind of customer relationship of all because it’ s based on shared values rather than impressions or other misleading metrics that mean less than you think they mean. To get good at this, and for it to be ef fective, you need to do this frequently . Create a schedule, whether it’ s every Monday morning or every Saturday night. Do it right now .

Your customers spend their time in different places, and you need to go find them. It’s okay to pick one social media channel that works for your business rather than trying to juggle them all. But the world is in flux, and new platforms are constantly spinning up. You may find more success on TikTok, Clubhouse, Dispo, or something new that doesn’t yet exist. The important thing is to try . Eventually you’ll find the platform that will let you advertise your business by being you. You don’t have to blog four times a week if a monthly newsletter with meaningful content is what you can manage and is more suited to your business. As with social media, experiment with how best to use your email list. If you send something out and readers unsubscribe en masse,don’t do that again. But if you offer your knowledge, your insights, your experience, a discount, and you see a response, do that again and again. Eventually , your business will start to grow organically . You will no longer have to push that boulder up a hill.

[head A] How Laura Roeder used marketing to grow Laura Roeder , founder of Paperbell and Meet Edgar , has used many of these same strategies to build her companies. For Paperbell, a scheduling and client management software for personal coaches she founded in 2020, she decided on SEO-driven content marketing to engage her audience. Early on, she hired an SEO consultant to compile a spreadsheet of keywords that reflect the search intent of her target customers. At first she was worried that using SEO would compromise the quality of Paperbell’ s resources and advice for coaches, but instead it’ s helped focus her writing and has resulted in organic growth. “The amazing thing about SEO is that it’ s a long term play ,” she says. “It only gets better over time if you put ef fort into it.” Though she does eventually hope to actively build up followers on Facebook and Instagram, right now she puts most of her energy into regular blog posts and product update emails, which she describes as her favorite marketing copy . All of the changes Paperbell makes to its software at this stage are in response to requests, so the update emails are a chance to delight customers who are invested in Paperbell’ s progress. “Founders put so much time into researching social media strategies,” she says, “but the only way to discover what will work is to try it, see if you like it, and watch to see if your customers respond.” As the founder of multiple companies, she finds it freeing that there’ s no one right path for everyone and every business. She knows because she’ s made changes between MeetEdgar and Paperbell. With MeetEdgar , a social media scheduling tool she founded in 2014, she and her team didn’t of fer trial subscriptions because the software required a time commitment to learn and to set up. But since then, there’ s been a profound behavior shift in the way people research tools and consider s oftware. “Free trials are table stakes,” she says. New customers aren’t interested in marketing information; they open six tabs and want to get started comparing their choices right away . With MeetEdgar , she first tried invitations, but now both MeetEdgar and Paperbell offer trial subscriptions. 103",583
Page 104,"Laura is a big believer in building an email list from day one. Paperbell’ s list comes from her first customers as well as from those who’ve signed up for free trials. She also has a regularly changing lead magnet on the website to collect email addresses. The list is key because Paperbell is a low cost software option for individuals rather than for teams, which means the math doesn’t work to do demos or to have a dedicated sales team to reach customers. “A lot of entrepreneurs think they have to start something totally new ,” she says, “but a proven market makes your job so much easier .” With the way people buy on the internet, the quality and consistency of your marketing means that you can get on people’ s radar and you don’t always need to create a unique product category to be successful against bigger companies. Instead, you can build great software and a great community into an impactful, sustainable business through patient, strategic and consistent marketing. [head A] Spend money last Press cycles about million-dollar fundraises and billion-dollar valuations are short-lived and targeted at aspiring entrepreneurs, not people like your customers. It doesn’t work, because a months-old startup has nothing to say , besides that a few rich people gave them some money . Trust me, I know . Most growth you see is paid for . So if you are jealous of someone’ s constant press and stratospheric growth, keep in mind that they are likely burning cash in order to acquire customers and to promise them an experience or a product that could come to an abrupt end at any moment when the money runs out. It is quite literally growth at all costs. [INSER T ART26] 104",366
Page 105,"This is backwards. You started your business to help a group of people you care about, and your product is what you of fer them, not your ad creatives. But it is too easy to fall for that trap when these are the examples that get the spotlight. Your product is not for everyone, so you shouldn’t try to reach everyone. That’ s way too expensive. And If you’re spending money to get followers, to get customers, or to get eyeballs on your product, you’re buying an ad no matter what it’ s called. There are display ads, social media ads, ads in newspapers and magazines, outdoor advertising, ads on the radio and on podcasts, direct mail, video ads, product placement, event marketing, influencer marketing, email marketing, and more. This is an expensive set of rabbit holes to go down, which is why it’ s important to wait as long as you can before doing so. Ideally , you should have a clear idea of what’ s already working. Then, and only then, you can spend money to accelerate that. The stories about your business will be stories about your struggles, your customers, your learnings, and your journey . It will create more fans. Who will in turn become your customers, who in turn will tell others about your business. There’ s another reason to figure out how to grow using your time and the customer base you currently have. Relying on advertising, even if it works for you today , may eventually get too expensive. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the move from 105",335
Page 106,"traditional to digital advertising across all industries, which in the long run will drive the 73 cost of ads up year over year . Just like you don't want to rely on social media companies to mediate your relationships to your customers, you don't want your business model to depend on outside companies providing you with af fordable advertising. The sooner your marketing function is as sustainable as the rest of your business, the better . And there’ s no better time to start than from the very beginning. [head A] Spend money on your customers Instead of thinking about loyalty programs as a marketing function, think of them like genuine rewards to loyal customers. Startups like PayPal and Uber spend millions of dollars paying their users to help them grow . But this may pose an obstacle to real growth. If people are only sharing your product because they are being financially rewarded for it, it is unsustainable. Instead, you can use loyalty programs to encourage repeat visits, or of fer discounts for leaving a business review online or for sharing it on social media. But don’t forget a common sense rule: don’t pay more than you make. Eventually , you can worry about getting headlines. Once you have a business with customers, getting coverage becomes much easier . At that point, you can go beyond the outreach to community reporters and micro-influencers that I mentioned in Chapter 4. Now you’re ready to of fer your product for free to reviewers and more established influencers, or you can of fer samples of your products or exclusive information on your company to bloggers and journalists who cover your space. But most of all, you can just tell your story . You can be yourself. You worked hard for this. You struggled. You can show others that their hard work and struggles will be rewarded too. Helena Hambrecht, co-founder and co-CEO of Haus, an aperitif brand, sees enormous potential in enlisting your best customers as marketers. This is one of the strategies she and her husband, W oody , a third generation winemaker , are using to market their natural, lower alcohol by volume spirits which they sell direct-to-consumer . She and W oody didn’t have money to put into paid marketing and customer acquisition, but from the first product launch at Haus, she reached out to her community and pitched stories to the press and to individual influencers who she knew would be excited by the story of the company and the beautiful content she posts on social media, including some of her own photography . 73 000 digital advertising across all industries : Ali Mogharabi, “Digital Ad Spending Poised for Exceptional Growth,” Morningstar, Inc., December 11, 2020, https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1014195/digital-ad-spending-poised-for-exceptional-growth. 106",593
Page 107,"Given budgetary constraints, it would have been impossible for Haus to generate all the content they need for social channels, and that’ s why Helena believes in “putting the power in customers’ hands.” Haus relies on user generated content to generate word of mouth. Lo-fi content shot on an iPhone and genuine customer voices convey the authenticity that is a hallmark of the brand and that speaks to potential new customers. The key she says is to build relationships, to make contributors feel valued, and to give them the tools they need to make content that they can not only use for Haus but that they themselves will be proud of. “Marketing doesn’t have to be fancy to be impactful,” she says. “It has to be real.” Though Haus does spend money on ads, she notes that advertising performs best when it’ s surrounded by a lot of organic content. She and I and many others believe that this is the only way paid marketing makes sense. Ads are anything openly sponsored and non-personal that are used to sell an idea, a political candidate, a business, or a product. The bad news is that we still live in a world in which huge corporations spend thousands or millions of dollars to reach thousands or millions of people, and entrepreneurs are up against the sophisticated marketing departments and advertising agencies of Disney , Coca Cola, Nike, and the like. Though technology hasn’t completely leveled the playing field, it’ s made advertising a much fairer fight. There are more places to buy ads, with smaller audiences. And the more targeted you can get, the less you have to spend. This is good news for small businesses that don’t have the large ad budgets that Fortune 500 companies and VC-funded startups do but do have committed, well-defined communities. You can advertise on Yelp, or Instagram, picking a specific geographic location or only people interested in oil painting and John Singer Sargent . If you’re selling a painting course about how to oil paint the human figure like 1900 impressionists, this can be incredibly ef fective. A lot of people interested in those things will still not be interested in buying your product or service. A lot of people who like ice cream won’t buy your ice cream. They may be dairy-free, or only eat ice cream on date nights, or they may like looking at ice cream more than they wish to actually eat it. Or perhaps they used to eat ice cream every day , and now they’re repenting for it. Who knows? You certainly don’t. But somebody (spoiler: Facebook) does. You don’t need a whole marketing department, you just need a Facebook account. With their help, you can compete with the world’ s largest brands in just a few hours a week. [head A] 107",602
Page 108,"Take advantage of lookalike audiences I’ve already talked about the idea that the scale at which you can be successful with advertising is shrinking every day , thanks to software and the internet. As you browse, services like Facebook and Google collect data on your habits. They know what you need, want, and like. They may even be able to predict what you’ll need, want, and like tomorrow . For better or worse, this is no longer surprising. Also not surprising is that the more you know , the more successful your ads will be at converting members of your audience to customers. Collecting and using customer data is a strategy that’ s here to stay , but it inevitably leads to questions about internet privacy and how companies use, and unfortunately sell, that data. From the outset, I’ve said that minimalist entrepreneurs should be selling to their users, not selling their users. In practice, that means building a product that solves a real problem for your customers, only selling to customers who are already convinced by your product, and only using your email list to send important information (not spam) to people who have opted in. The same logic applies to ads. If you choose to spend money on advertising, you should do it in a way your customers would be happy about. As a bonus, you’ll be able to spend less money to reach each new customer . At Gumroad we don’t spend any money on paid customer acquisition for three reasons: 1) we can reach out to creators directly; 2) their usage of Gumroad makes their own communities aware of Gumroad; and 3) I’m happy with our current growth rate. But paid ads can be a valuable tool for other entrepreneurs, for example, ones selling high-quality consumer goods or even restaurants. That said, you should be mindful of the very real data privacy concerns users will have when they are on the receiving end of targeted ads. Ultimately you have to decide if paid customer acquisition is the right fit for you and your business. If you do decide to spend money , you will be glad that you waited. That’ s because you’ll have a much better idea of who your customer actually is, and therefore who else may fit their profile. For example, you can ask–and pay–Facebook if they happen to know folks who closely resemble your customers. These are called “lookalike audiences,” which Facebook describes as “a way to reach new people who are likely to be interested in your business because they're similar to your best existing customers.” Instead of buying ads to target large swathes of the population, wasting their attention and wasting your money , you can instead tell Facebook: “please tell people who most resemble my existing customers that I exist.” [INSER T ART 27] 108",586
Page 109,109,5
Page 110,"Each company has their own name for this kind of ad. Pinterest calls them “actalike.” If you decide to spend money on this at all, it’ s a good way to get started. But remember that this kind of targeted advertising is also becoming more expensive over time, possibly rendering a previously sustainable business model unsustainable. I could go on and on. There are a million dif ferent ways to advertise. But you should rarely if ever need to. A business built primarily through organic growth will be durable to start, but even more durable over time as the businesses that heavily rely on paid advertising start to struggle. Instead of spending money , spend your time. Build relationships, have passionate customers who spread the word, and then think about spending a little bit of your profits to slightly expand your horizon. If you can do that, you will stay lean and grow at a comfortable rate that never overextends your business. But paid marketing should never get in the way of what really matters: talking to and selling to customers. [head A] Bottom of the funnel: Sales Ultimately , this is what marketing is all about: selling to customers. Good news: you have a ton of experience doing that. That’ s why this part of the funnel is short and sweet. You’ve already done the hard work of building a product, finding initial customers and making sure you’ve solved their problem. Now you get to revel in the fruits of your labor as your marketing starts to do the much more scalable work of attracting many more customers to you. [head a] Key takeaways [bullet] - Marketing is not about making headlines, but making fans. - Start by educating, then inspiring, then entertaining. Each of these three levels of content is more far-reaching than the last. - Paid advertising can work, but it has its cons.

To keep your balance you must keep moving . 74 – Albert Einstein In this chapter , we’re going to talk about what comes after you’re profitable and have a growing customer base. For some of you, this will be relevant right this second, but even if you’re not there yet, don’t skip over this part. It will save you a lot of heartbreak if you can start thinking now about how to grow sustainably and how to avoid some of the most common mistakes founders make. You may be earning a nice living for yourself and your family , and in theory , your journey and the journey of your company could be coming to a close. But for many , including me, the point is not to create a lifestyle business, retire on a beach somewhere, and be done with it. That said, the reasons to grow are dif ferent for every founder . Even though I got comfortable with the non-unicorn outcome for Gumroad in 2019, I’ve continued to invest in its growth. For one, it’ s fun and satisfying to work on a continuously improving project. Two, it feels good to find new ways to create value for our creators. And frankly , staying put doesn’t work. The world is constantly changing, and we and our businesses have to change with it. Staying put is a great way to start going backwards. You don’t need to grow like crazy , but you also don’t want to grow stagnant. I’ve seen this play out at many companies. They solve the problem, get complacent, and over the years their customers churn and the people they hire are no longer fired up. But being a minimalist entrepreneur isn’t just about owning a business that doesn’t own you, but it’ s also about owning a business that you want to work on, even if you don’t have to work on it anymore. At this stage, the real question is: how can I grow with intent, without jeopardizing the impact I make for my customers or damaging the life I’ve built? On the surface, it might seem straightforward to stay the course when you start to see results, but slow , sustained growth is its own kind of challenge that requires deliberate, conscious decision making. When businesses fail, it’ s unlikely that a tornado of unforeseeable misfortunes is the cause. Instead, it’ s usually one or more of the same handful of mistakes: overspending on inventory and of fice space, hiring too quickly , co-founder infighting. I’ll talk about how 74 000 you must keep moving : Letter to his son Eduard (5 February 1930), quoted in W alter Isaacson, Einstein: His Life and Universe (New York: Simon and Schuster , 2007), p. 367. 112",618
Page 113,"to avoid those mistakes, but also about how to deal with them, because it’ s likely that some of them will happen to you, even if you try to avoid them. There are two categories of self-inflicted mistakes, or “unforced errors,” to watch out for . The first set relates to running out of money , and the second set to running out of energy . Let’s start with some basic economics and go from there. [head A] Don’t spend money you don’t have [INSER T ART28] It sounds so simple: make more than you spend, your company can keep on going forever . Make less than you spend, you will eventually fail. But you’d be surprised how often founders ignore profitability (read: sustainability) and focus on product development, growing, hiring, and all kinds of other things right up until the money runs out. Paul Graham, founder of Y Combinator , can size up a company immediately based on whether they’re “default alive or default dead.” If expenses and revenues stay constant, will the company live or die? Incredibly , half of the founders he 113",250
Page 114,"talks to have no idea. 75 In Graham’ s experience, the founders don’t know because they don’t think they need to know . They’re counting on investors to swoop in and save them if things go south. But if you’re bootstrapping your company , you have to watch your own balance sheet because there’ s no one coming to save you from your own mistakes. Let me state the obvious. You should already have revenue coming in from the hundred customers you sold to, plus however many you have acquired via the marketing methods I covered in the previous chapter . So if you’re profitable now , you should be able to keep it that way , by focusing on the only part of the equation left to discuss: costs. There are two kinds of costs. The first is variable cost, also referred to as the “cost of goods sold,” or COGS: the cost associated with selling each marginal unit of product. In brick and mortar businesses, that includes costs like labor , packaging, raw materials, and more. For early software businesses, COGS applied because software was put onto CDs and sold in retail stores. Things have changed a lot since then. The internet makes it much cheaper to collect payments online. And “shipping” some electrons over the internet is virtually free too. For example, for each dollar we earn at Gumroad, we incur about 40¢ of variable costs. This 40% consists of payment processing fees, web hosting costs, other infrastructure costs, and fraud prevention (a necessary evil of helping people transact online). That leaves us 60¢ per dollar . But that 60¢ isn’t pure profit - we still need to pay the second kind of costs, fixed costs, which don’t scale linearly with our revenue and each incremental product sold. This includes everything from our domain name to our web hosting, but these aren’t the main expenditures for us or for most businesses, minimalist or not. The number one fixed cost is people. It’ s either that, or real estate, but if you’re building a minimalist business, you should have minimal capital costs. So, people.

Starting with you, so… [bullet; PE: please preserve bold] ● Pay yourself as little as possible, at least to start. You are a founder , but you are also the first employee. Treat yourself as such. Don’t expect to take dividends. Instead, pay yourself an annual salary even if it is just $1, and then increase it over time as you can af ford to. This will force you to do the work to get your systems set up, so you can have an accurate picture of how much or how little is required to run your business, not just sell your product. If you’re worried about making a living, I get it. That’ s why I’ve recommended again and again that you start your business as a side project and use your time, energy , and ideas to grow the business to profitability before you leave your day job. Then, you can pay yourself as profits allow . In my case, when Gumroad 115",287
Page 116,"started to work, I paid myself $36K a year , just enough to cover basic living expenses in San Francisco. Over the years, I increased my salary but tied it to the salary of the lowest-paid person at the company: $60K, then $85K. When things went sideways in 2015, I paid myself $0 for a while. Now , I pay myself $120K a year . Ultimately , you should be trying to minimize your business’ s burn, but also remember that the goal here is to provide yourself enough of an income to be able to focus on what matters: helping your customers solve their problems. ● Hire software, not humans. People are expensive. Software is not, usually because a lot of it is VC-subsidized in the name of growth. Take advantage of this by using Pilot or Bench instead of hiring an accountant or a CFO. Use Gusto to run payroll and benefits in five minutes. Because you are putting of f hiring, you will also save money on all of the people-managing roles in your company like an HR person and an of fice manager (see below). You may be surprised how far you can get with cheap software tools. For example, you can hire a human being to follow up with new customers every time someone signs up for your service OR you can use automation tools like Zapier to send a followup email and to add those new customers to a queue to call later . ● Don’t get an office. I believed this pre-pandemic, and I, and millions of other people who weren’t already convinced, will believe it afterwards. An of fice creates an insane amount of associated costs. Plus, you now have to manage an office. Unless you really need one, avoid it. (Y ou can get one later if you really want it as a reward for building a meaningful, sustainable, business.) Thanks to the pandemic, there’ s a list of businesses a mile long that have become “digital by default,” as Shopify founder and CEO Tobi Lutke put it , but 76 others, like Upwork, have always thrived with distributed teams. Either way , even giants like Google, Microsoft, Morgan Stanley , JPMorgan, Capital One, Zillow , Slack, Amazon, PayPal, Salesforce and other major companies have extended their work from home options post-2020, so if they don’t need an of fice, you probably don’t either . 77 ● Don’t move to Silicon V alley . Even before 2020, I would have said, “Don’t quit your job, don’t move to SF , don’t pass go, and don’t collect $200 (from VCs).” After all, San Francisco is expensive, traf fic-heavy , and not a great place to raise 77 000 you probably don’t either : Jack Kelly, “Here Are The Companies Leading The Work-From-Home Revolution,” Forbes , May 26, 2020, https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/05/24/the-work-from-home-revolution-is-quickly-gaining-mom entum/?sh=3ba83da81848. 76 000 CEO Tobi Lutke put it : Tobi Lutke, Twitter Post, May 21, 2020, 10:55 AM, https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1263483496087064579. 116",745

Sam Altman, the former CEO of Y Combinator , said that he was “very excited to see SF have to compete with other cities.” Me too. Not only is it cheaper and less competitive to build your 78 company in a smaller town or city , it’s also better for the local community , which as we've learned can pay dividends for your business. ● Outsource everything. It’s all you, every day . For now . Then it’ s software. Eventually you and your army of robots will be at maximum capacity and you'll need help. But before you hire your first full-time employee, use freelancers. I’m not talking about exploiting good, hard working people by paying them less than they deserve. I mean hiring future founders and other potential minimalist entrepreneurs, of fering them opportunities to learn within a functional, profitable business, paying them well, and giving them a chance to earn money while spending the rest of their time as they like–maybe even starting their own minimalist businesses themselves. If you can use these tactics to keep your costs lower than your revenues, you shouldn’t die. Even better , you’ll have something worth keeping: a profitable, sustainable, growing business serving customers. It’ s no longer up to the market to decide if what you built was valuable. It’ s now up to you not to lose it. (This may seem overwhelming. To help, in the Learn More resources at the end of this chapter , I included Gumroad’ s actual P&L with all of our costs, as well as simpler examples.) In the last chapter , I described how the Doans used YouTube to grow the Missouri Star Quilt Company from a struggling mom and pop machine quilting shop to a global quilting empire. If you’re just starting out, it may be hard to imagine successful founders making the same kinds of decisions you will have to make as you try to grow your own business, but it’ s also useful to remember that “don’t spend money you don’t have” was and continues to be one of their guiding principles just like it’ s one of yours (and mine). The success of Missouri Star feels like a foregone conclusion, but it wasn’t obvious at the start that the company would succeed, or even survive. “It took four years before we were profitable and could begin to pay our own salaries,” Al Doan said. “W e were doing everything ourselves, including renovating the buildings we bought, as we slowly figured out what worked both for our customers and for the company itself.” The good news for Missouri Star was that as a bootstrapped business headquartered in Hamilton, Missouri, it was much easier to keep costs lower than it would have been in Silicon V alley or another market with expensive labor and real estate. “W e started with a 5,000 square foot store that we thought would last us forever ,” Al said, but they 78 000 “have to compete with other cities” : Sam Altman, Twitter Post, May 21, 2020, 1:56 PM, https://twitter.com/sama/status/1263529191581954049. 117",716
Page 118,"eventually had to separate the company’ s inventory into multiple shops where they could house specialized fabrics, notions, and trim. As Missouri Star expanded, the “retail warehousing model” in which the people who worked in the physical stores also fulfilled online orders also started to break down as employees could no longer simultaneously handle in-person and online sales. The solution was obvious but also scary: to meet customer demand, Missouri Star would have to separate its retail business from its online one, which meant new warehouses, increased inventory , and more employees. As minimalist entrepreneurs, Al and his family were rightly concerned about a radical increase in the company’ s variable costs, but because Missouri Star was already profitable and its revenues were growing year-over-year , they had the confidence (and the money) to support their expansion. Al also had enough experience to know that avoiding growth and trying to maintain dysfunctional systems wasn’t a good idea. “W e didn’t hire a human resources person until we were at 150 employees,” he said because it felt wasteful to pay someone to perform a function he’d performed for years, “even if [he’d] done it badly .” It took a few incidents and some intervention from a friend with an HR background for him to realize that investing in HR would be worth the cost. “Otherwise,” he says, “you end up with several eight-hour jobs.” Beyond what the business has meant for the Doan family , Missouri Star Quilt Company has transformed the small town where it’ s headquartered. When asked about the impact on the community in 2019, Jenny Doan said that at first, “I thought we were just sewing,” but now they employ 400 people. In addition to growing Missouri Star , they’ve also started a sewing company , a knitting company , and an art company . As Jenny says, “W e have more ideas than we have buildings at this point.” 79 The Doans’ story of fers many dif ferent lessons for minimalist entrepreneurs. Even if it’ s the goal, growth is its own challenge. Far too often, companies with plenty of talent and market potential run into trouble not because of the product or the customers but because of the unglamorous but essential parts of running the business: Operations. Finances. Legal. In the world of VC, where millions of dollars are thrown around on wild bets in the hopes of landing a single winner large enough to erase all your losses, people tend to be...over-exuberant, lavishing generous perks like pool tables and free food. Don’t get swept up in what a “successful” business is supposed to look like. Keep doing what’ s working, stop or improve the processes that aren’t, and always, always, always keep an eye on the numbers and your ears on your customers.

Page 119,"Stay focused on what your customers want The tuning fork you should resort to over and over again is quite simple: your customers. Your customers do not want you to get bigger and grow faster . They do not care how rich you are, if you were on the Forbes 30 under 30 list, which venture capitalists you raised money from, or how many employees you have. They want your product to improve, and your business to stick around. That’ s about it. Amazon has a nice way of thinking about this: “In every board meeting in Amazon HQ stands an empty chair . That seat represents the customer and the customer voice. So everything that is developed and created is scrutinised by the voice of the customer . That voice is what the people in the meeting room ask if they were in the place and shoes of the customer . Why is this product important for me, what value does it bring, do we really need this service or product?” Even though we’re not trying to build Amazons, this attitude is even more important if you are at the helm of a newly profitable, growing minimalist business. As an African American father of six children, Jelani Memory , founder of Circle Media and A Kids Book About, inevitably found himself discussing racism at the table with his blended family of four white and two brown kids. Memory decided to write a book for his own children, one that would describe his experience with racism in terms they could understand. The book, A Kids Book About Racism , was simple with no illustrations. He proudly designed and printed one copy; it took four weeks to produce. It gave him a jumping of f point for discussing hard things with his own children, but even more surprisingly , when he showed it proudly to other friends and parents, many wanted a copy for their own families. Even though he was in the midst of raising Series B for Circle Media, the idea of starting a publishing company had taken hold of him. By January 2019, he negotiated an exit. At that point, he started to tell everyone he knew about his ideas for A Kids Book About -- these were his potential early customers after all -- and seeing their reactions and feeling “the power of possibility in the look on people’ s faces” helped him refine not only the business but also validate his bigger project of publishing kids books on challenging, empowering topics. That energy kept him going through early challenges including learning about publishing in general and figuring out how to manage inventory . He launched A Kids Book About in October 2019 with twelve titles, and it grew steadily but modestly until May 2020. The day after George Floyd was killed by police on May 25, 2020, “A Kids Book About sold as many books as it had the whole previous month. And it didn’t slow down,” Memory said. “The following day , sales went up 2x, and the day after , went up another 2x and held steady . So, within the span of 10 days, A Kids Book About saw north of $1 million 119",625
Page 120,"in revenue.” Their inventory was supposed to last the rest of the year , but they sold out of every single one of their titles but two. 80 Those sales figures validated Memory’ s belief in the product he was of fering and in the possibility for growth within a changing world. He says, “there is a misconception that money or investment confers validation and permission to do things in conventional and expensive ways, but that’ s not true. It’ s about product, revenue, and traction. Most of all customer af fection is the permission you need to grow .” If you stay focused on what drives sales and what excites your customers, then you’ll know how to grow; they’ll tell you. And if you pay attention as you go, even as you do unwittingly make unforced errors, it will be your customers (or the lack thereof) who will show you how to get back on track, far before you would have otherwise noticed. Finally , be diligent about the essentials. It’ s easy to excuse sloppy practices when you’re growing and feel overwhelmed, but that’ s the moment when you need to be most disciplined about how you spend your own time and money . Not just because of the implications for your bottom line but also because nothing brings a business screeching to a halt faster than a legal problem or a break in the supply chain. Paychecks need to go out on time, and it’ s on you to avoid any legal, financial, or operational complications that might sink the ship. Vendors need to be registered in the system and paid promptly . IT security needs to be buttoned up tight, particularly around user privacy . You need to run a good, clean business to establish and uphold your reputation with employees, vendors, and customers. Chances are, however , that one or more of these areas lies outside your area of experience. You probably lack even the basic knowledge to hire the right help. That’ s okay . We’ll talk more on hiring in the next chapter . Until then, good news: your customers can and will help connect you to people who can help, especially if you’re open with them about what you need help with. They’re already incentivized to help, because they use your product and want to make it better . And there’ s another way to get them even more involved with your success: turning them into owners. [head A] Raise money from your community Growing businesses, even minimalist businesses, may need capital at some point. Raising money can make sense, once you have adoring customers, and you know how 80 000 every single one of their titles but two : Megan Rose Dickey, “The Journey of a Kids Book Startup That Tackles Topics like Racism, Cancer and Divorce,” TechCrunch , August 18, 2020, https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/the-journey-of-a-kids-book-startup-that-tackles-topics-like-racism-canc er-and-divorce/. 120",654
Page 121,"you would spend additional capital, and how impactful that would be for your customers. Shopify , for example, and 1Password, raised money several profitable years into their lives. Because they were both profitable when they did it, they were able to keep their vision aligned, their dilution low , and retain control of their companies. If you do choose to go the venture capital route, profitability will give you leverage. But there are also new ways to go about it, ones that preserve your ownership and empower your customers. I don’t just mean new venture capital funds such as Earnest Capital (disclosure: I am an investor), Indie.vc, and Tinyseed Fund who are all looking to invest in more sustainable, perhaps minimalist, businesses. While traditional venture capitalists are looking for the “grand slam” to pay for the rest of the strike outs, these firms are building a portfolio with a higher hit-rate, allowing them not to over-optimize for finding the single company that returns their whole fund. But they are far from the norm. What I am mostly talking about here is a totally new way to raise money from your customers and your communities: Regulation Crowdfunding. In 2012, President Obama signed the JOBS Act into law. This bill, among many other things, included the ability for private companies like Gumroad to sell shares to the general public. This makes it possible for almost anyone to invest in a business. On March 15 2021, the legal limit will be raised from $1.07 million to $5 million. The new rules will also allow for “testing the waters,” allowing companies like Gumroad to see how much demand there is before commiting to a crowdfunding campaign. This means that, similarly to testing out a manual valuable process before building a minimal viable product, companies will be able to make sure there is enough demand for their offering (in this case, equity in their company at a certain price) before committing to the relatively complex process to raise money via Regulation Crowdfunding. (Though it is getting easier and cheaper all the time, as new businesses get built to make it so!) I believe that crowdfunding will reorganize the funding landscape. Of course there will always be a place for venture capitalists. But who better to fund a business than its customers, who understand how valuable its of fering is? And once founders can vet demand before committing, we should see the numbers skyrocket. In the old way , the number one downside of raising money is that you create two distinct sets of stakeholders: your investors and your customers. This new practice will allow minimalist entrepreneurs (all entrepreneurs, really) to minimize this complexity by turning customers into investors. All of a sudden, you have a single group of people you are serving: your community . 121",570
Page 122,"I can speak from experience: on March 15, 2021 I used Regulation Crowdfunding to allow some of Gumroad’ s creators to become part-owners. Now, we have thousands of our creators as our investors too, keeping our interests more cleanly aligned. For the businesses who don’t need to bootstrap completely , nor want to go the venture-backed path, I’m hopeful that Regulation Crowdfunding will of fer a middle-ground. But the ultimate long-term goal is always profitability (read: sustainability). [head A] Build Profitable Confidence I know I’ve said over and over again that profitability is the metric that matters most to your business. That’ s because profitability is a superpower . If you rely on VCs for capital, like we did, you rely on outside forces to be successful. When they pull the plug, you have no more electricity . Your backup generator will last a certain amount of time, then run out too. But profitability gets you of f the grid. Then you grow mindfully with unlimited runway . You can take your time and make the right decisions to move towards the right targets at your pace, not someone else’ s. Chris Savage, CEO and co-founder of Wistia, a video and podcast marketing platform, calls the resulting sense of conviction “profitable confidence.” I n 2017, Savage and his cofounder Brendan Schwartz realized that their ef forts to scale and grow quickly had not only made their work less creatively interesting, but had also made them unprofitable. By slowing down, they figured out how to trust their instincts again--and wound up more profitable than ever . For Wistia, being profitably confident means that he and Brendan know they will live no matter what they do. It allows them to pursue ideas at their own pace and that frees them up so that every single thing doesn’t have to work immediately (or even at all). They don’t have to bet the company anymore if they want to try something new , and they can wait for something to pay of f. This feels great, because you can truly invest in the stuf f that you think will create a lot of value for your customers, not just the stuf f that will “move the needle” on your top-line growth metrics as soon as possible, so that you can raise the venture capital you need to keep going. When you are profitable, you can take your time. You can talk to customers, and really make sure you understand their problems before you attempt to solve them. Then, you can iterate on your solution over and over again until you’re really happy with it even if you take years to do it. You could even show customers and get their feedback again! (We often do.) 122",585
Page 123,"Remember , since you are running on your own steam, your runway will now last you forever . You will not die, unless you do something stupid. This means you need to hire slowly , not ambitiously . You should avoid irreversible decisions like getting a multi-year office lease. Moving slowly will mean you will have to ship more thoughtfully , and slower too, but over the coming years you will build a phenomenal product and loyal customers. Even though you may see others rocket up far past you on sexy metrics, they will not be able to surpass your product, no matter how much money they raise, and burn. And the odds are you will be around in ten years, and they won’t. Growing sustainably and moving slowly gives you time and space to learn about yourself, your customers, and your market. It will also give you a clear view of the road ahead. You will be able to detect bugs in your product and systems before they af fect your customers. You can test your software in private beta with customers, or behind a waitlist. You can make sure it’ s good enough before you give it a wide release. This way, your customers continue to appreciate every thoughtful addition you make and to love your product without worrying about the mistakes that accompany quick changes and rash decisions. [head A] Maintain your energy and sanity Once your business is too well-run to fail, there’ s one more failure point to address: you. Your business won’t run out of money , but you may still run out of energy . One of fastest ways to drain your enthusiasm and to lose steam is a co-founder fight. According to Paul Graham, founder disagreements are par for the course, and 20% of those situations escalate until one founder departs the company . 81 [INSER T ART30] 81 000 one founder departs the company : Steli Efti, “The Secret to Successful and Lasting Co-Founder Relationships,” The Close Sales Blog , December 23, 2020, https://blog.close.com/the-secret-to-successful-and-lasting-co-founder-relationships/#:~:text=One%20of% 20the%20biggest%20causes,have%20had%20a%20founder%20leave.%E2%80%9D. 123",495
Page 124,"No one gets married expecting to divorce, and most co-founders don’t anticipate that things won’t work out either . But ultimately , relationships are relationships, and it can be useful to apply frameworks for personal relationships to professional ones if they apply . Drs. John and Julie Gottman, well-known couples therapists, say they can predict the end of relationships using “The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,” their name for four types of communication styles that start to appear in a relationship: 1) criticism; 2) contempt; 3) defensiveness, and 4) stonewalling.

Page 125,"tackling their conflicts head on and eventually rediscover common purpose and mission, others never do, and one founder will move on. [INSER T ART31] In Startupland, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Startups are encouraged to “fail fast,” and founders often cycle through several teams at the same time they’re cycling through ideas. But there’ s also a lot of truth when people say , “it’s harder to divorce your cofounder than your spouse,” so if you want to give your business the best chance at success, approach the relationship with your co-founder(s) like a marriage. Think about the following before you team up for the long haul: [bullet] ● Do not start a relationship with someone unless you really , really trust them. ● Do introduce vesting, so that each of you earn your stock over several years. ● Do make sure you are aligned on your values, what you want to build, how you want to build it. 125",222
Page 126,"● Do not ignore the possibility that one of you may leave. Plan for what a successful exit from the business may look like. ● Do have the hard conversations as early as you possibly can. Just like there’ s no point in dating someone for five years before you figure out if they want what you want, early in any serious professional relationship, it is important to explore and understand each other ’s values and ambitions. Because hard conversations get harder the longer you wait to have them. Here are some questions it’ s worth asking your potential partners: ○ What does a happy relationship look like? ○ What does success for this business look like? ○ What does an exit look like? ○ How fast do we want to grow? ○ Why are we starting this together? Have these hard conversations again and again. Think about specific check ins to re-evaluate these goals so that disagreements don’t fester silently , and make sure that whatever path you plan on taking, you’re all on the same page about it. The conventional wisdom is that there are two kinds of startup founders: on one end of the spectrum, you run a lifestyle business and lounge on the beach all day , and at the other , you work 24-7, only stopping to eat or sleep when absolutely necessary and sacrificing exercise, rest, family , the outdoors, and whatever in your life gives you pleasure and sustenance. There’ s a lot of real estate between those two extremes, and just like your business needs to change and to grow to keep from getting stagnant, so do you as a human being. I’d be lying if I said that being a minimalist entrepreneur doesn’t take a lot of hard work, but it doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing proposition. I can speak from experience, as I’ve changed my mind about what I wanted out of Gumroad quite a few times. For the first several years of Gumroad’ s life, I was chasing unicorns. Then I right-sized the business to profitability , and today it’ s one of a few things I am working on, like this book. Generally , I don’t let my business make me too happy , so that it can’t make me too sad. But it took years for me to get here, and the kind of people who wanted to work on Gumroad at each phase were very dif ferent. I basically had to rebuild the whole team from scratch. When you’re growing at all costs, it’ s easy to avoid these conversations. It’ s easy to justify not having them too: you’re all focused on growth, and these conversations aren’t helping you grow in the short-term. But in the long-term, as your business morphs as 126",594
Page 127,"every business does, you need to have them. Or they’ll happen to you when you least expect them to, and that’ s a lot less fun. To be clear , this isn’t about scaling back your ambitions in order to make your business work. Because I’m not trying to build a billion-dollar business at all costs, my focus is on creating more creators and business owners. And frankly , you often can’t grow faster if you try . I’ve worked 60 hours a week for years on end, and I’ve worked four hours a week. For better or worse, Gumroad grew at its own pace, and the number of hours I worked didn't seem to have much of a correlation. I think you’ll find the same is true for you: your company will grow as quickly as your customers determine it will grow . For us, that was 15% in 2017, 25% in 2018, 40% in 2019, and 87% year-over-year in 2020. It taught me to be wary of thinking I always needed to do more, earn more, or grow more than I needed to. Once I came to terms with the reality that I couldn’t control everything, it got a lot easier to move forward. Instead of pretending to be a product visionary and trying to build a billion-dollar company , as if it were within my control, I could focus on making Gumroad better for our existing creators. Some say that you need to grow like crazy , because “if you don’t get big, someone else will eat you.” As if companies were fish. This is wrong. The vast majority of small businesses are never eaten. Big fish want to eat other big fish, generally . In fact, the longest lived businesses in the world are also some of the smallest. They are restaurants, hotels, construction companies, and more. Many of them are family firms, or small to mid-sized enterprises content with steady evolution of their niche and a passionate multi-generational customer base. Something to aspire to! Maybe you already know this. Maybe that’ s the business you already aspire to build. If so, I’m glad. But it wasn’t obvious to me when I started out, and I see these ideologies pervade and persist in social media, within headlines, and on TV. One more economics lesson to wrap up: there’ s no free lunch. Once you have it, you will feel the pressure to spend money more loosely . Keep in mind the lessons we covered in this chapter as you start to spend your customers’ money , making sure you’re treating it like your own. It may be tempting to solve your problems with money–and people–but that usually only exacerbates things. Instead of hiring like crazy , hire when it hurts. This way you’ll have a more mature business for new folks to fit into. Plus, you’ll minimize the whiplash that comes with building a rapidly changing business with a bunch of revolving faces. 127",641

Build the house you want to live in [epi] You can dream, create, design and build the most wonderful place in the world…but it requires people to make the dream a reality . 83 - Walt Disney Whenever I have to decide what to do next, I ask myself the question Gary Keller poses in The One Thing : “What's the one thing you can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?” 84 That’ s why , in this book, we’ve focused on community before process. W e’ve focused on process before product. W e’ve focused on sales before marketing. W e’ve focused on marketing before growth. When it comes to the people in your company , the answer to that question is to focus on culture before hiring. Before you’re ready to hire anyone, you first need to make a company people want to work for . That begins with setting your values, preferably as early as possible, because values are the foundation of the culture you will build together with your employees. I used to think that communicating company values was kind of dumb, to be honest. Be nice, work hard, show up on time--isn’t it obvious? Then I started Gumroad and realized that if you don’t constantly remind everyone–including yourself–what you do, how you do it, and why you do it, you will veer of f course. And then you’ll have to make corrections, usually at the most inopportune time. For me this happened in the fall of 2014, when I first started having conversations with VCs about the next round of funding for Gumroad. When I realized that it wasn’t going to be easy , if at all possible, to raise our Series B round of funding, I had to realign several team members around a very dif ferent kind of culture–one focused on building a profitable, sustainable business rather than a unicorn. We didn’t shift our priorities–we were and still are creators first–but our new focus required me to have conversations 84 000 “be easy and unnecessary” : Gary Keller and Jay Papasan, The One Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth behind Extraordinary Results, London: John Murray, 2019. 83 000 to make the dream a reality: Jeff James, “Leadership Lessons From Walt Disney - How To Inspire Your Team,” Disney Institute Blog , www.disneyinstitute.com, March 21, 2018, https://www.disneyinstitute.com/blog/leadership-lessons-from-walt-disney--how-to/#:~:text=Walt%20Disne y%20once%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CYou,make%20the%20dream%20a%20reality.%E2%80%9D. 129",620

You will make mistakes, but your company values will give you a plan of attack for how to get back on track. Today , 26 people work on Gumroad, based all over the world, and they seem quite happy! But I had my fair share of ups and downs to get here. In this chapter , I’ll share everything I’ve learned the hard way about hiring the right people at the right pace and keeping them happy and productive in the face of a never-ending barrage of lucrative and glamorous of fers for their talent, particularly in the technology space. I also address the challenges and opportunities of remote work and other unconventional approaches to solving problems with people. It’ s an ongoing process that never really stops. Before you invite anyone over , you need to get your house in order . I’ve never seen a house party end cleaner than when it started, and a company is a house party that never ends. So, let’ s get started figuring out what kind of house you want to live in and then filling it with the awesome people who are going to come along with you on this journey . [head A] Define your values early and often Values are not generic two word commandments that companies use to state the obvious. Quite the opposite: they’re for stating the non-obvious, in non-obvious ways. They codify what you believe, putting it in a place where everyone can see–and everyone can suggest changes. Values are oral tradition. They tell employees a story of how to behave in both every day and extreme situations. And they’re more ef ficient mediums of information than manuals and handbooks. That’ s because good values stick in the brain; they’re ef ficient and memorable. Zappos is one example that many of us know . Its 10 Core V alues include things like “create fun and a little weirdness” and “do more with less;” and all ten stand out from 85 the generic way that many big companies describe themselves. Google’ s company culture is defined by “T en things we know to be true,” and its list is completely dif ferent from Zappos’ s. Google begins with “focus on the user and all else will follow” and “fast is better than slow ,” but its values also reflect a commitment to maintaining product 85 000 “do more with less” : “What We Live By,” Zappos.com, December 3, 2019, https://www.zappos.com/about/what-we-live-by. 130",628
Page 131,"quality for the user and maximizing clarity for employees. Both companies have stated these values publicly , and Google says, “you can hold us to [them].” 86 That’ s because values aren’t just for the people within the company . They tell your customers and the people who may consider working for you that you exist, and that they might be a great fit. More importantly , they tell everyone else that your company isn’t right for them, saving you, and them, precious time. Nordstrom, for example, is famed for its customer service. In one iconic story , a customer brings a set of tires to the store to return even though Nordstrom sells clothes, not tires. The store accepts the tires anyway and fully refunds the customer . In another , a clerk can’t find the right pair of shoes at any nearby Nordstrom store, recommends a competitor , Macy’ s, and covers shipping for the customer . These stories communicate more about the kind of service Nordstrom–and its customers–expect than a 1,000 page manual on “how to be a good sales clerk” ever could. You could start working there tomorrow and already have a good sense of what kind of standards you would need to uphold to be a good “fit.” That absolute clarity is particularly important for minimalist entrepreneurs because we often attract people for whom this may be a first job. Defining and communicating your company’ s values early sets expectations for how work is done, and how disagreements are handled within the organization. They’re not just a vehicle for you to push your will on your team. They help hold your team together and provide a way for your team to hold you accountable. Values supersede you, and values allow you to scale. After all, one of the reasons you started a business is to control your environment: when you work, how you work, where you work, who you work with, who you work for , and more. V alues make sure that everyone is aligned on what that looks like. Values let you define that environment for yourself, your customers, and for current and potential employees, even when it means making dif ficult decisions. Natalie Nagale, co-founder and CEO of Wildbit knows this firsthand. She and her husband, Chris, founded Wildbit in 2000, and in 2012, the growth of Beanstalk, the workflow software that was one of their core products, plateaued. “That was an important time for us,” she says, “because we were forced to ask why we were building and what we wanted to grow .” Defining the company’ s values and principles, which Wildbit sees as two separate, but interrelated entities, was part of figuring out the way forward. One of Wildbit’ s principles is that the company is product agnostic, which helped them make the decision to shift Beanstalk to maintenance and support mode. When they finally stopped trying “to put out Beanstalk fires,” they were 86 000 “you can hold us too [them]” : “Ten Things We Know to Be True,” Google, Accessed February 27, 2021, https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html. 131",686
Page 132,"able to focus on intentionally growing Postmark, an email delivery service that was their other core product. In the years since, not being defined by one project or product has given Wildbit more freedom to celebrate every opportunity to learn, which is one of their core values. In practice, this means that if something, even a long term project, stops being interesting, challenging, or fulfilling, they move on. After five years, Wildbit shut down Conveyor , meant to be a successor to Beanstalk, in 2020; this might have been devastating for another company , but for Wildbit, it made space for their team to launch two new projects, People First Jobs, a job board to connect people with companies that take the same kind of approach they do to work, and DMARC digests, a monitoring service to prevent scamming and spoofing. Making decisions that af fect the lives of your team and your customers is not something to be taken lightly . But if you’ve decided on your values and you’ve developed a culture around them, it will be a lot easier . A lot of founders think they can wait to write down their values, that they’ll appear to them just in time and that culture will develop naturally . That’ s true, but be forewarned that it may not be a culture that’ s good for your customers, your team, or you. You can start small, and grow from there. But it is important to start having these conversations–even if it’ s just with yourself. You can communicate your values through pithy statements, or you can draw them out into long stories, but you should start. At Gumroad our values exist in a culture doc titled “What Matters.” And to help you get started with your own, I’ve embedded them for your reference below . They may not be exactly the right values for your company , but I hope they’re a good starting point for reflection and action. At this point you are already familiar with Gumroad, the product. Introducing… Gumroad, the company! [head B] Judged by the work This value is about being real about what matters: the experience creators–and their customers–have when they use Gumroad. How I communicate this internally: [extract; PE: please preserve bold] Our creators don't care about us. They care about the product, content, and community we happen to provide. That means a few things: 132",519
Page 133,"[bullet] - While we often work in silos, we do not ship alone. Everything we send to creators is of the highest quality , meaning that *everything* is reviewed by multiple people on the Gumroad team, our creators (they're first!), and other folks in our broader community . For example, I published my Work article after addressing 600 comments from 150 people. That is extreme, but it meant hundreds of thousands of people read something better . - We are okay with employee churn (in fact, I encourage it) if it helps us ship a superior product. Lastly , it should be considered a failure to receive feedback on something that could have made a creator's life better *after* you shipped . [End extract] [head B] Seek superlinearities This value is a way to define and to encourage growth. Though superlinearity is a mathematical concept referring to a function that eventually grows faster than any linear one, at Gumroad it represents our willingness to learn at a constantly accelerating rate. How I communicate this internally: [extract; PE: please preserve bold] We have a fixed number of hours, and an unlimited amount of creator income to actualize. Everything we do should contribute to our creators' bottom lines in a measurable and scalable way . Every day you are producing superlinear returns on your time investment. Often this means that one’ s job at Gumroad changes quickly . It also means they may outgrow their role and leave Gumroad to start their own company . Great! [head B] Everyone is a CEO This value is about building a company of like-minded people. I’m a CEO, and I think it’ s a pretty great job, so I want to create a company full of them. How I communicate this internally: [extract; PE: please preserve bold] 133",379
Page 134,"Ultimately , you are responsible for spending our creators' money , and it's your job to tell the company how you're doing that. You are the CEO of your function, and it is your responsibility to make sure it is executing at a high level and communicating proof to the rest of the company–and our creators. You need to think strategically (about business and product), proactively get things done, ask for help when needed, and hold yourself accountable before I need to. Similarly , don't waste resources: [bullet] ● Provide all the context anyone needs when asking anyone for their time and attention. This should include objective measurements**.** ● Everyone is doing something important when you ask them for help, so do what you can to save them time and expensive back-and-forths . Think like a CEO asking for approval from their board, not like an employee asking their manager for direction. If someone needs to ask you how things are going, they are not going well . [end extract] Most people don’t want to be CEOs; most people don’t want to work for a company that has these expectations for its workforce. That’ s fine too; the people who do want to become CEOs find our situation appealing, and they’re the people I believe can create the most value for our creators anyway . [head B] Dare to be open Given you’re reading our internal values, this is likely the most clear of the bunch. How I communicate this internally: [extract] If there's a Gumroad secret, it's this one: we aim for complete information symmetry . There's nothing I know that you don't, and eventually there'll be nothing you and I know that our creators don't. 134",363
Page 135,"We are building the best product, with the best team, for the best community . Being open about everything is the flywheel that brings more amazing people into our ecosystem. [end extract] This manifests in numerous ways like making our onboarding documents publicly available and sharing our financials on Twitter every month. That way , not only does everyone who works at Gumroad know what we’re about, but our customers and anyone who might even think about working at Gumroad knows too. I recommend this level of transparency to everyone. The upside is that some of the people who get to know more about your company will love you. The downside is that some won’t. They won’t agree with the way you do business. They’ll disagree with your policies on product quality and remote work or pick apart your numbers. That’ s okay . Just like you built up a solid customer base made up of community and fans of your product, you’ll also have supporters and detractors of the company overall. Having a point of view and putting it into practice can be polarizing, but if what you’re doing works for you, your customers, and your employees and the company is profitable, you can sleep at night knowing you’re doing the right thing. Another plus is that when things aren’t going well, transparency can lead to the kind of reflection that will make things better . The most profound thing I have learned running a company has been the dif ference between behavior and intention. Behavior is what someone is doing, intention is why they're doing it. Most people judge themselves based on their own intentions but then judge others based on their behavior . Transparency makes that dif ficult, if not impossible. As the CEO of an impactful company , it’s important for me to be open about my intentions. Then others can look at my behavior and suggest improvements so that they match up better . Sunlight may not always be the best disinfectant, but it often helps. Transparency isn’t just about what we show to the world; it’ s also about how we operate internally . In Chapter Three, I talked about the processes we use to run our business, all of which are documented and available for every employee to see. Day-to-day , we use tools such as Slack and Notion to keep everyone in our company aware of what is happening and to give employees clarity about how their work matters. It's easy for people to peer into anything if they're curious (or take over if need be). The cumulative effect of the open environment we’ve created with public numbers, no meetings, and open communication is that there are no secrets and no FOMO. For example, everyone at Gumroad can see via an online dashboard how much our creators are earning. It does run the risk of creating a counterproductive obsession with the numbers (sometimes it is the founder ’s job to worry about the bottom line, not the employees’), but generally I’ve found that empowering your team with the data they need to make their own decisions creates a better , more self-suf ficient organization. 135",654
Page 136,"Plus, it means you need to do less, which is a big reason you chose to be a minimalist entrepreneur in the first place. We also give everyone access to the traf fic dashboards, and several of our engineers, when they are looking to take a break from their normal workload, will go in there and see what pages of the site they can speed up. These are things I may never have prioritized, but they save our customers time and improve our product. Ultimately , if you hire well, your employees will be better managers of themselves than you could ever be. And in the long run, giving everyone autonomy allows you to be a peer to your employees so that you can code alongside your engineers, design alongside your designers, and spend your time creating and building something impactful rather than constantly managing others. As long as you continue to lay out the long-term version for the company based on clearly articulated values, your employees will be happy to support you. Transparency also matters when it comes to the harder things like money . At Gumroad, we disclose everyone’ s salary in the company to everyone else, using a simple spreadsheet I keep up to date. This lets people feel good about how much they make, and reduces the information asymmetry between me and the rest of the team. Revealing that kind of information may seem scary at first, but that’ s just because it’ s unusual. In practice it vastly reduces the number of questions people ask about their compensation, and it also helps combat wage disparity because of bias. Laying out the numbers behind the business and the salaries you’re paying people tells your employees how their work contributes to the overall profitability of the business. That information makes it easier for everyone when it comes time to have an honest conversation about how much they deserve to get paid. Global studies reveal that 79 percent of people who quit their jobs cite ‘lack of appreciation’ as their reason for leaving, and though it’ s normal, even expected, for employees to outgrow your company and move on, you don’t want unnecessary turnover to be a part of the culture of your business. [head A] Beware of the Peter Principle I don’t like to manage. I would much rather have ten amazing people on my team than a hundred good ones. That might mean that we cannot ship as much code as the next startup over , on an absolute basis, but on a per-person basis we are far more productive and more fulfilled because of it. Ultimately , a company scales successfully because employees are empowered to help customers without your intervention. Your job, and the job of any management team you build, is to give them the resources to succeed, and when necessary , the 30,000 foot 136",568
Page 137,"view, so they can clearly see where their work fits into the big picture without having to do the stressful work to find out for themselves. Don’t be a product visionary–or worse, a product dictator . Your company shouldn’t be a cult of personality , building exclusively what you want on the timelines you decide. WeWork is one example of how that path leads to certain doom; among the numerous excesses, questionable decision making, and lavish capital infusions based on little evidence that the company might ever be profitable, one fascinating detail stands out. Even though W eWork’s business has nothing to do with surfing, the board approved a thirteen million dollar investment in a company that made artificial wave pools because former CEO Adam Neumann is an avid surfer . 87 That, of course, is an extreme case of the ways in which a CEO’ s ideas and preferences, however irrational and counter to the interests of the business, can sink the business itself, but the point still stands. Whether you have three employees or three hundred , have clear key performance indicators (KPI) that everyone knows about and can measure their work against, which will allow everyone to either talk to or build for customers. The Peter Principle, coined by educator Laurence J. Peter , states that “the tendency in most organization hierarchies, such as that of a corporation, is for every employee to rise in the hierarchy through promotion until they reach a level of respective incompetence.” 88 Though meant as satire, you may be able to relate to the idea that within a strict hierarchy , everyone gets stuck with the job they’re not good at. At Gumroad, I’ve tried to turn the Peter Principle on its head. Employees work for customers. I work for my employees. The best people continue to do the jobs they’re best at as they get promoted–they just get paid more to do it. [INSER T ART32] 88 000 “a level of respective incompetence” : Laurence J.

Page 138,"The problem with managers is that they aren’t really invested in the success of the people who they manage. But sometimes, it’ s more than just being invested in your employees’ success on the job; it’ s about caring about and investing in your employees’ career aspirations and growth — beyond what your company might require. It’ s about the long-term game for everyone involved. This might even mean encouraging your employees to leave to find more growth elsewhere, which we’ll cover at the end of this chapter . [head A] Create accountability Gumroad has been remote since 2015. I think that remote work is going to be the norm for pretty much every business that doesn’t need an of fice. Which is, almost every business that pivoted and figured out a way to keep going with a distributed team during the COVID-19 pandemic. When you don’t have an of fice, you don’t need to restrict yourself to the folks in your local geography . You can hire people across the world - finding the best people and bringing them into your company without either of you ever leaving home or needing to fly halfway across the world. Win-win. 138",256
Page 139,"Once you’ve taken that step, you might realize that other conventional wisdom about how to run a company doesn’t make sense either . Meetings, for example. Most companies use meetings as an essential tool to get their work done, but we don’t have meetings at Gumroad. W e’ve even taken it a step further , and we’re fully asynchronous. This has meant that for us, all communication is thoughtful. Because nothing is urgent--unless the site is down--discussion takes place only after mindful processing. But what happens when something urgent does happen? The truth is that our business model doesn’t produce the kind of “drop everything and deal with it now” situations that might occur if, for example, your company is reliant on business development and a key customer is pulling out because of a feature degradation or a missed deadline. If something does require near-immediate engagement, we use Slack as our closest-to-real time communication channel. GitHub is where we keep our codebase and where engineers submit their code for peer review before it is merged in and deployed live. Notion is for everything else. It is what we use to host our roadmap (which we make public to customers) and our product development processes, as well as where we house our knowledge sharing around how each person does their job. This three prong system is a useful heuristic to help employees know where to go to get help when they need it. In a few hours, Slack. In a day or two, GitHub. Longer than that, Notion. Transparency around metrics and team compensation is important – but it's also important to make it easy to surface the right information at the right time for the right people.) If something does need to be discussed in really-real time, we now use Clubhouse for audio-only conversations. As a bonus, we can pull our customers into the meeting much more easily than if it were a Zoom call. This culture requires everyone to tell everyone else when they plan to do deep work, a term coined by writer Cal Newport indicating focused, cognitively demanding tasks. Much of the work we do, including writing, coding, and designing, doesn’t lend itself well to interruptions. Beyond setting expectations, people can decide how they wish to implement this. They can let others know when they plan to surface and respond to questions, or they can turn of f their notifications for weeks on end. For me, this is as simple as blocking out times in my calendar . Clear expectations about availability allow people to build their work around their life, not the other way around. This is especially great for new parents, but everyone benefits from being able to structure their days to maximize their happiness and productivity , and most people can learn to manage themselves and be productive and impactful. I recognize that what I do and what we do at Gumroad may not work for every founder or every company depending on the nature of the business. While flexible work hours are becoming more common, some companies work well when they are totally 139",632
Page 140,"asynchronous and remote like us, and others use a hybrid of remote work and shared time at coworking spaces. But if everyone is dedicated to your product and customers, those decisions will make sense rather than feeling like something dictated from the top. Ultimately , it’s up to you to decide what kind of house you want to live in, and find people who agree. Our values are a little of fbeat. You might even say they’re a little scary . But they’re ours, they work for us, and they communicate what the world needs to know about Gumroad. These values also don’t work for most people. You may think that everyone wants unlimited freedom, because you do. But running a company is not the same as working for a company . Some prospective employees expect clarity , structure, and a clear story they can see themselves as an active character within. They want that structure through meetings, deadlines, and other accountability devices. For those people, Gumroad isn’t a fit for them. Luckily , there are millions of other companies that are. [head A] How Simply Eloped defined its values and got back on track Hiring before defining your values and culture is a challenge many founders face, but the good news is that it’ s an issue you can come back from, and you can right the ship before it capsizes. Janessa White and Matt Dalley are two founders who ran into trouble when they started hiring at Simply Eloped, a company that helps couples plan intimate or destination weddings. “The first two and a half years were magical,” Janessa said. “It was just the two of us plus one other employee, and it was really exciting to see our idea take root as we helped people all over the country plan one of the most special days of their lives.” Matt and Janessa were doing everything right. They grew slowly and were strategic about every dollar they spent. Up until they started hiring, they had performed every function—customer service, marketing, sales–themselves, and it had allowed them to develop their own systems and to be adaptable, flexible, and creative especially when it came to money . They had also made conscious choices about the vendors they hired to represent Simply Eloped. “The wedding industry can be full of discrimination, so from the very beginning, we built relationships with of ficiants, florists, bakers, and others who shared our values and felt comfortable with all sorts of couples. I had spent years talking with customers,” Janessa said, “and I knew that we were offering a kind of af fordable, inclusive service that people couldn’t find anywhere else.” Even though Matt and Janessa had been deliberate about the kinds of external relationships they wanted to cultivate, they hadn’t been as intentional about the culture 140",598
Page 141,"they wanted to build inside Simply Eloped. In 2019, they raised capital and began a hiring push. “W e made every mistake in the book,” they say . “Once we had the money and were growing quickly , we hired for our wish list, we hired friends and family , and we hired anyone who seemed nice and wanted a job.” The result was what Janessa called a “cultural crisis” during which bullying, gossip, and drama became commonplace. Their first step was to hire a leadership coach and to begin the process of identifying what was happening more clearly . The company went through a 360 review process, and Matt and Janessa started to ask themselves what kind of leaders they were and what kind of leaders they needed to be to manage a growing team. They saw that they had focused too much on making their employees “happy” and not enough time defining what would best serve their customers and provide the best work atmosphere. Secondly , they realized that even though they and many of their customers loved the company , it wasn’t going to be the right fit for everyone. This revelation sent them back to the drawing board to consider their values, which they now define using the acronym CACAO for customer-centric, ambitious, compassionate, adaptable, and ownership. What’ s more, they translated those values into a list of attributes that describe the type of person who will thrive at Simply Eloped, and they now use that list for their job postings. With respect to hiring itself, Simply Eloped instituted a more clearly defined process with multiple interviews and standardized questions. As a result, the company now attracts leaders that are better able to exemplify and model the company’ s values day-to-day . Creating and living the company values has been so transformative that Janessa, Matt, and their team use them frequently to highlight success and to give feedback; during the weekly announcements, Janessa uses company values to tell stories about employees’ s small wins; on the flip side, if someone isn’t performing well, she can use the values as context for how and why to improve. Values have ended up being so important at Simply Eloped that Matt and Janessa even wrote a song about them that every employee learns. While you may not want or need to write a song with your company values (we definitely are never going to write a song at Gumroad), it’ s worth emulating how clearly Janessa and Matt articulate and define the company’ s values, for themselves and for everyone who works there. They’ve found something that works for them, and their clear values enable them to grow knowing where they’re going and who they want to bring along with them. [head A] 141",571
Page 142,"Tell the world who you are Ultimately , it will be more work to build your company culture than your product. But it will also be more valuable. And at the end of it, you will have a company that fulfills your goals and the goals of many others as well. People do not change jobs often, and they often don’t declare to the world when they’re thinking about doing so. In Chapter Five, we talked about how marketing is about reminding prospective customers that you exist, over and over again. Similarly , hiring well is about reminding prospective candidates that you exist, and why you exist, over and over again. And just like we learned in Chapter Four , good sales isn’t just about sales–it’ s about education. Hiring is one of the hardest things about startups, because it’ s about product development, sales, and marketing–all at once! Once you have cultural values that work for you, start to communicate them publicly . Many people fear that communicating these values will alienate people from looking further into their company . This is exactly correct. Cultural values allow most folks to say “this isn’t for me,” and a select few to say “THIS IS EXACTL Y THE JOB FOR ME!” Great people will only apply if they see a job that matches (or exceeds) their expectations for what their ideal work life could be like. If you can, reflect on how painful and stressful a job search you’ve had to embark on was, and how often you got to the end of a long interview process with a company to realize they weren’t a fit for you at all. Communicating your values also saves you time. You only want to interview the candidates that think they’re a really good fit for you, not people who are just looking for their next job or a pay raise. Ultimately , the greatest candidates are the ones who plan to replace you. [head A] Hiring looks a lot like firing yourself From the beginning, you should look to hire people who are better than you. They’re not there to implement your vision but to improve upon it based on their own interactions with customers. Some of them may even be your previous customers. At Gumroad, we make a point to hire from our community first. Many founders fail to delegate well. It begins with self-awareness. Ask yourself: [bullet] 142",506
Page 143,"● What do I most enjoy doing? ● What am I good at, what am I not so good at? ● What function would be a relief to pass to someone else? ● How do I spend most of my time and is that the right choice? Once you figure out exactly what job you are hiring for, you can figure out who may be a fit. But often, you won’t know . Again, this is why it’s important to get good at shouting out into the ether , and letting people come to you. Your job listings should be a filter , not a magnet. Most people won't enjoy working at your company , and your job listings should make it clear that they should look elsewhere. The people who get all the way through are the ones you should have more serious conversations with. If you do this well, hiring becomes much easier and faster . And because of your minimalist approach to building your business, you already have communities, customers, and a marketing muscle with which to best engage them. For example, a single tweet from my personal Twitter account led to hundreds of applicants: [extract] We're looking for engineers who want to work on @gumroad! - Web (Ruby + JS) or iOS (Swift) - 20+ hours a week - $125-$200/hr - Work from anywhere, no scheduled meetings, no deadlines [end extract] This isn’t just true for me. Adam W athan’ s single tweet about a job working on TailwindUI led to 875 applicants. His tweet, similar to mine, was clear and opinionated: [extract] $115k–$135k/year , 4 weeks vacation, and 40 hours a week of hacking on fun, interesting problems. 89 89 000 hacking on fun, interesting problems : Adam Wathan, Twitter Post, May 24, 2020, 3:32 PM, https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1264640396640096264. 143",416
Page 144,"[end extract] Revisit your values, and make sure they are embedded in your job post just like everything else that you write. For Gumroad that means making it clear how much we pay, what we expect of our people, and what we don’t offer. But your values will be different from ours, and so your job posts will be too. [head A] Fit is two-way Unfortunately , not everyone who joins your company will stick around for the long term, or maybe even the short term. Fit is two-way; when someone isn’t working out for you, it also means you weren’t working out for them. And someone who isn’t a great fit for your company is hurting their own long term prospects just like they are hurting yours. When in doubt, reflect on your values. Does this person match? W ould this person be creating more value outside of our company than within it? W ould you hire them today , if you knew what you knew now? Truthfully , when you start doubting, you probably know the answer and just aren’t comfortable making the hard decision of letting them go. Believe me, I know how dif ficult it is to fire people. But it is an essential skill if you want to build the house you want to live in. To my people, I promise no surprises. Even if it’ s not a fit, I make it clear–and due to our asynchronous culture, in writing–exactly why I have concerns that it may not be a fit, and correspond each change with our values. I do this at least twice over several weeks, making sure they have the clarity and time to make the changes I need them to make. But ultimately it’ s their choice, and often the best thing you can do is to have an honest conversation, tell them it’ s not working out, and wind things down. Almost every time, they’ll be grateful you brought it up instead of them. And if you’ve been hiring well, they’ll find a new job in no time at all. And you should help them with that, providing introductions and a positive reference. Remember , you hired them. They weren’t bad employees, they just weren’t a fit. Too many people – especially founders – perceive people leaving as a failure. It is not. Your company is a business, not a cult. Embrace change, don’t abhor it. At this point you’ll have a product that customers are happy paying for and a company that people are happy to work for . What’ s left? If you’re having fun, you can keep doing what you’re doing. Or you can also keep going. That’ s what the next chapter is about. W e’ll talk about broadening and deepening your impact, as well as how to improve your own quality of life.

And yet we do not become hopelessly lost, because each walker who comes before us leaves behind a trace for us to follow . 90 Robert Moor This chapter comes last, but I rank it first in significance. Even after reading this book, you may be asking yourself if now is the right time to start a company . There is a lot broken with the world, and the future is uncertain. Starting a business may look risky . And it is and likely always will be. But I believe it’ s one of the best ways to make change. Never mind if your business is not solving the “big” issues from day one, or doesn’t employ hundreds of people. As long as you’re making the world better in an honest, scalable way by selling a product worth paying for to a community that wants it, starting a company is worth it. I don’t think healing the world only happens if we are able to make “a dent in the universe,” as Steve Jobs is famously misquoted; it also comes about by repeatedly making small choices that compound and that improve our communities. You can’t change everything, but you can and should change a few things, to start. The reward, once you’re profitable and growing sustainably because your customers are spreading the word, is that you get to decide what your company’ s next positive impact will be. I know that once Gumroad got to that point, it was easier for me to focus on a more meaningful life. But it wasn’t easy . I had to wrestle with a new definition of success, one that would be defined and underpinned by a greater sense of purpose and mission. “A healthy man wants a thousand things, a sick man only wants one,” Confucius is purported to have said. Rephrased in the context of this book, a minimalist 91 entrepreneur without a successful, sustainable business only wants one thing (that!), while one who has achieved it has the world as their oyster .

With all that behind me, I was free to chart a dif ferent course. I found that when I wasn’t trying to placate investors or to make the company grow faster than it was meant to grow , finally , I had time. While I was no longer on track to become a dollar billionaire, I realized I was a “time billionaire,” someone Graham Duncan defines as having at least a billion seconds left in their life–or 31 years. 93 I didn’t have a billion bucks, but I did have the luxury (or agony depending on how you see it) of obligation-free days for the first time in a long time. I rented a modest apartment in Provo, gave up cof fee and beer , and started meeting people who shared my creative interests. After years during which work was the crux of my identity , I wanted the next part of my life to be about more than just earning money . I wanted those billion seconds to count.

That way , I had as much time to do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted to do it. Is this possible for everyone and every business? I’m not certain. But I do think that you’d be surprised at all the stuf f you don’t need to do, if you extricate yourself from situations and obligations your former-self would have considered essential. Then, I went back to the beginning of my journey . I started creating again. First, I wrote fantasy in Provo as part of a creative writing workshop taught by Brandon Sanderson, one of my favorite authors. Afterward, I stuck around Utah and learned to paint. It probably isn’t a surprise, given that I run a company that employs creators and serves creators, but I like creating stuf f. Creating ex nihilo is satisfying and fun, especially when it doesn’t need to pay the bills, and running a minimalist business allowed me to progress at a rapid pace. At some points, I spent upwards of 20 hours a week writing and painting. (And I haven’t stopped!) But for me, making stuf f doesn’t complete me, just like chasing unicorns didn’t. I still cared about having a large impact on the world, and I still had a business to help me do it. I didn’t need Gumroad to be a billion dollar company to be free to pursue my goals with maximal optionality and minimal baggage. And I promise that you don’t need your business to be that big either to accomplish all you hope to accomplish. I believe our goal should be to bring together our passions, our missions, our professions, and our vocations. This is the Japanese concept of Ikigai, which aligns what you love, with what the world needs, with what you can be paid for , and with what 93 Tim Ferriss, interview with Graham Duncan, The Tim Ferriss Show , March 1, 2019, https://tim.blog/2019/03/01/the-tim-ferriss-show-transcripts-graham-duncan-362/. 150",734

You can live in the present while working towards a better future. I believe strongly that the arc of humanity is in its infancy , and the way we make progress is via mindful business creation. One key reason I’ve used the word “minimalist” to describe entrepreneurship in this book is because I believe your business does not need to be the answer to every question. Becoming a minimalist entrepreneur may result in a great outcome for you while also creating opportunities for your team and your community . But it is unlikely to solve every problem you encounter , either for yourself and for the world. And I think that’ s okay . The goal here is to free yourself, to make the business require as little of you as you wish it to, so that you can engage with the world in the way you 151",208

[head A] Create more creators, CEOs, and minimalist entrepreneurs After two years in Provo, I had a new perspective on Gumroad and my mission with respect to the company . When I reimagined the future, I realized I had the chance to not only make a life for myself but also, more importantly , to expand opportunities for others to make a life for themselves. Building Gumroad exposed me to a whole new range of creators: business owners. Not every act of creation requires a business, but many creators who reach scale start a business to manage their work. One of the things I’m proudest of is that I’ve made the business side of creation easier for thousands of other people and created business owners around the world. In 2020, I stumbled upon the next step in my journey to make entrepreneurship accessible to all. Up until then, I had experimented in investing in early-stage tech startups by becoming a Limited Partner in Arlan Hamilton’ s Backstage Capital and making several small angel investments in startups such as Lambda School, Figma, and Notion. But in the wake of the George Floyd protests in 2020, I knew I could do more, and I tweeted about wanting to invest in Black founders. That tweet demonstrates the power of an audience. It led to 200 emails from Black founders and–most importantly–four new investments in startups founded by Black entrepreneurs. Since then, there have been several more through in-network referrals. But many of these startups were looking to raise more capital, and I didn’t have very much. So I wrote a “memo” and emailed other investors in my network. One responded, “you should start a fund” and of fered to anchor it to help get it of f the ground. So I doubled down on my goal of creating more CEOs and minimalist entrepreneurs and launched my own fund last year . Even though I never expected to be a venture capitalist myself, I am now able to support the kind of founders I meet primarily through my audience and through building Gumroad openly and transparently . Today I get to invest approximately $10 million dollars a year in about 50 companies. I still turn many founders away , but that’ s not necessarily because I don’t believe in what they’re doing. It’ s because most businesses would be better of f without venture capital. Ever since I published “Reflecting on My Failure to Build a Billion-Dollar Company” in February 2019, I’ve met hundreds of minimalist entrepreneurs who match my mental model for what a business really is. And even though I am an investor now , I also want to create more of those too! (Can’t you tell?) 152",610
Page 153,"Showing other people the way is a good thing to do, if you think becoming a minimalist entrepreneur yourself was good for you. I’m not the only one who thinks so. Peter Askew regularly tweets out domain names that he thinks would make great businesses so that others can follow in his footsteps. Chris Cantino and Jaime Schmidt of Schmidt’ s Naturals started their own investment fund, Color , which supports and invests in underrepresented founders, and launched Supermaker , an inclusive media platform to elevate emerging entrepreneurs and to provide a voice for women and people of color . Being a creator and a minimalist entrepreneur is a path that should be available to a huge array of dif ferent kinds of people, and all dif ferent kinds of employees and customers should be able to find the exact right fit for them. I would argue it should be available to all eight billion people on this planet. Alas, we’re not there yet. Though minimalist businesses cannot eliminate discrimination or repair every disparity in access to education, technology , and funding, they do of fer a pathway for a wide variety of entrepreneurs to take control of their own destinies. Furthermore, I believe the path to a more equitable future is for more people to create a product or service and sell that, not only because it allows business owners to make a living from creating but also because by expanding the reach of entrepreneurship we can serve people whose problems have not yet been addressed by the free market. So, another one of my answers to the question of “ What’ s next?” is to continue to make these opportunities available to all by creating more creators, CEOs, and ultimately minimalist entrepreneurs For me, that meant going back to Chapter Two of this book, and contributing to communities. It’ s different the second time around; I’m not starting from scratch. I have much more money and power now because I have the same kind of network and knowledge that VCs traditionally provide. But I can at least use that money and power to fund new founders, as well as to share what I’ve learned with anyone who wishes to listen. Ultimately , it’s up to everyone to decide how they want to run their life and their business. Moving from San Francisco to Provo reminded me that people have their own visions of how they want to serve others. It’ s not one-size-fits all, not even close, nor should it be. Dif ferent people have dif ferent problems and require dif ferent solutions. [INSER T ART36] 153",534
Page 154,"[head A] Save the planet We’ve talked about the myth of “changing the world” being a distraction from the forest of great business and community-serving opportunities you’re already in. But you can still pick battles to fight, especially things that are within your control like offsetting your carbon footprint and committing to a carbon neutral future. Large organizations, which fuel the systems and servers that many minimalist entrepreneurs use to power their businesses, are accelerating this process and making it more straightforward to commit to carbon neutrality . In 2019, Shopify committed at least $5M annually to the Shopify Sustainability Fund, which will invest not only in carbon sequestration but also in renewable energy and more sustainable operations for both merchants and buyers. By 2030, Google has committed to running on carbon free 94 energy everywhere at all times. 95 But it’ s not just about relying on big business and its infrastructure to do the work for us. We can use our companies to make our own contributions to saving the planet no matter what size they are.

One idea kept coming to mind: ice cream. She set out to build Rainbow Road into a company that makes delicious ice cream by way of a full cycle, circular system that is good for the earth. “Pono is a word in Hawaian that means harmonious,” she says, “and I keep the company and myself in balance by always keeping our mission in mind as I make decisions and tell our story .” Having raised VC capital for her two previous companies, she’s committed to bootstrapping for now in order to preserve full decision making control and to focus on profitability and taking her time. “I’m creating longevity by building a foundation more slowly ,” she says, “and I sometimes wonder , ‘what if someone else can do this faster?’” Rather than dwell on that, instead she asks herself, “what is the next smallest step I can take?” That has allowed Rainbow Road to grow in a way that feels sustainable for the company and for the world. “I can grow something really substantial with baby steps, so I’m not afraid of taking the longer path.” Do your research, figure out what really works, and start putting your mouth where your money is. [head A] Let go I haven’t taken this path yet, but I’ve thought about it. One day I may want even more of my time back, or I may want to serve a totally dif ferent group of people in a totally different way . Just like I don’t expect anyone else to work at Gumroad forever , I don’t expect to either . Ultimately I will let go–either by choice or force–and I certainly hope it’ s the former . You will ultimately have to make the same kind of decisions. You may walk away from your business completely . You may retire on a beach and feel like your work is done. You may decide to double-down, raise money , and take a big swing with your next company . You may find a new CEO, but stay involved in the running of the company as Chairman of the Board or start a non-profit to tackle the next problem you find. But where specifically do you go from here? The answer is that I don’t know . This question never goes away , and there will never be one right answer for every founder . This is why you should always try to build the right business for yourself selfishly , while also serving a community of others selflessly , all at the same time. And you should prioritize your happiness while you do it! 155",620

You shipped a manual valuable process and then iterated it into a minimum viable product. Why did you choose to solve those problems in the ways that you did? If memory serves me right, you then sold that product to 100 customers, who happily paid for it. Who did you reach out to first and why them?? You marketed the business and grew yourself and your team alongside it. Why, why , why? And finally: Why do I want to move on from here? Why do I need to go anywhere at all? What helped me, and what will help you as you tackle these questions, is to spend your newfound time reflecting on your past and observing the present to figure out who you are and what you really want. Then, you can figure out how to get what you want, so you can stop asking these questions at all. Your “purpose” may be to create more creators, or to help more people start businesses, or to retire on a beach. I won’t pretend to guess it.

And because you picked the right community to serve, and became a pillar within it, you have a good plan of attack to get started on building your MVP (manual valuable process first, then a minimal viable product). You’re going to get to 100 customers, and only then worry about launching! Soon after– or maybe you’re already there–you will be profitable, and in control of your destiny . You’ll learn how to stay there as you get a good grip on the legal, operational, and financial components of running your business. You’ll craft a culture that attracts the kind of people you love working with and for . It won’t be easy , but your business will grow , and you will start to solve new problems over time, in an almost “care-free” way . Most importantly , your identity will not be wrapped up completely in your business. You won’t need to do anything you don’t want to, at least not for more than a couple of hours a week. Take that Tim! Of course, even then the journey isn’t over . It never is. It won’t be easy or quick or straightforward. It will take a lot of time, and perhaps a few attempts, but that’ s okay , because you have a whole life ahead of you to figure things out. and It’ s not about avoiding failure but getting to success, eventually . The longer it takes to win, the more prepared you’ll be, because you will get better every year that it takes. In this book, we’ve mostly spoken about successful businesses. But every successful entrepreneur has many failed attempts. I know I did. In the years before Gumroad’ s creation, I built and launched several dozen things. Almost all of them failed. Gumroad worked, though. You only need one. But humanity needs millions, if we hope to get out of this mess. (W e’ll always be in a mess.) Regardless, I believe the future of entrepreneurship is the future of humanity , and so the more companies that get started the better . And the best way to get more companies started is to make it easy , accessible, and attainable. I’m not trying to convince you. Rather , I think you’ll understand it deeply when you’re running your own business. Your work is necessary . The business you will start is necessary . These kinds of businesses have been necessary for hundreds of years and will be for thousands of years more. There’ s nothing new about them. Humanity has always needed, and will continue to need, companies to solve new problems, and founders who are disciplined enough to keep them on the right track. If you’re struggling to even come up with a problem to solve, be patient. Look around and pay attention. Humanity is just getting started, and it’s unlikely that anything we do today will resemble how we do it in the future. 157",653
